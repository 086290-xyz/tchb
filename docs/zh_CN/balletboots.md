# 使用芭蕾靴做足尖立

As you know by now achieving the pointe can help you in order to do more
of the exercises better. However it's not always possible to have
footbenders made nor to have someone to assist you in stretching your
feet into the utmost pointe position. Normally this isn't a problem,
but the situation can occur especially if you live in a place where
no-one can assist you. This is a problem that often has been addressed
by internet users of this exercise schedule. At the same time many
ballet dancers has mentioned their everyday use of ballet boots as a
quite simple solution to this problem. Also one of the co-authors of
this handbook, Lotta, wears ballet boots only and on a daily basis. Much
of the information therefore comes from there as well as from the users
that has mentioned this.

Ballet knee length boots 

First of all if you're to wear ballet boots on a daily basis you should
wear ballet ancle boots and shorter. They won't restrict your feet as
much as ballet knee length boots and are more comfortable for everyday
wear once you get used to them. However as every ballet boot they WILL
force you to stand en pointé and that is also the point in wearing them.
The reason dancers wear ballet boots is to harden the feet, increase the
flexibility and strength (which however won't happen if you wear ballet
knee length boots for extended periods). Ballet boots can easily be
found in numerous shoe stores or Ebay on the internet.

When you order a ballet boot it's important that you see to that it is
of especially rigid making it impossible to move the foot out from the
pointe. This will make them perfect for their purpose.

The ballet boots help both in training the pointe as for holding the
feet when getting into and holding different positions. It's
uncomfortable, a bit painful and difficult to some extent in the
beginning. Telling otherwise would be lying, but it gives much quicker
results than using a footbender and the effects are better in the longer
run. If you choose this method it can also require quite much from you
since you will have to wear the ballet boots while you practice and as
much as possible on a regular basis. Usually it's said that that three
hours en pointe when using the ballet boots daily is a minimum and from
there the time should be increased by one-two hourse each week to month
until you can wear them as much as you wish. However if you're to wear
ballet boots for longer than six hours on a daily basis you must stretch
the feet to overpointe and also do the ballet positions daily for extra
strengthening. Otherwise you risk damaging your feet and can end up
being stuck in ballet boots!!!

If you wonder how it will be in the beginning the video clip shows a
perfect example. This is Lotta shot after one week of walking in ballet
boots. As you can see it wen't quite well even if it was a bit
unsteady, but again that was only after a week. It's a bit of learning
to walk all over again and today she walks in the ballet boots like if
they were any high heel shoes. However you should, as a new-beginner,
avoid walking in stairs in the beginning as this is far from easy.

Above you can see what it looks like when ballet boots are worn. As you
can see they can be used both as inner and outer wear as for clubbing..
and for exercising.. 

The ballet boots are constructed in a way that they force you to have
your feet in a fixed pointe or beyond pointe position. This is
accomplished by bonings and a strong lacing. After you've laced them in
you won't be able to move the foot into anything less than a pointe
position except for beyond a pointe position. Also, wearing the ballet
boots will reduce the shoe size by increasing the arch of the foot thus
decreasing the length of the foot from heel to toe. There are some tips
for you if you're to wear ballet boots on a regular basis. 

- Stretch the feet everyday after wearing the ballet boots! This way
  you'll avoid any ill effects of wearing high heels.
- Do the ballet positions everyday for as long as necessary to
  strengthen your feet. This way you'll avoid any ill effects of
  wearing high heels.
- Try to use 1 or a half size larger than your normal shoe size. The
  trying on for the first time can be very uncomfortable since you
  won't be used to have the foot in the pointe and especially when
  standing. While trying on the boots the laces of the boot should be
  completely closed and if you can't move the foot out of the pointe
  position the boot "fits like a glove". 
- Always lace the boots until the laces meet and you feel that you
  can't move your feet to less than the pointe position! 
- Gradually build up your endurance until you can wear them with no
  problems for many hours a day.
- Pad the toes. You're putting a lot of pressure on the tips of your
  toes, padding helps a lot. Lamb's wool seems to be effective, the
  stuffing from pillows helps, but you have to keep replacing it.
  Check with a local ballet store to see what they use, or check
  online.
- Keep your toenails short. It hurts to have your toenails pushed
  back.
- Stay close to something like a wall in the beginning, or stable
  chair when you stand. You may need to hold something for balance,
  falling on the floor is a bit ungraceful. :) 
- When starting out, walk with someone holding your hand. It might
  feel childish, but if you suddenly lose your balance it's better
  than falling and as they say you have to learn to walk before you
  can run.
- Always put the heel down first, then the toes.
- Take it easy. Don't start out wearing them for hours at a time, a
  half hour of standing and walking is just fine in the beginning, but
  never less than that.
- Practice the pointe either bare feet or using pointe ballet shoes
  daily if you wear ballet boots to build up strenght. Remember that
  the ballet boots only are an aid even if they are comfortable to
  wear.

Here are some pictures of dancers and contortionists using ballet boots
in their exercising. As you can see the feet always are in the pointe
position thanks to the ballet boots and in the first picture the foot is
stretched beyond the pointe position. Also notice that the ballet boots
can be a good help in order to make ease the exercises.
