# 关于后背和后弯的二三事

既然你决定开始练习瑜伽柔术，关于后弯的课程将是合适的。我知道你对这个主题最感兴趣，因为这是你身体的一部分，你可能将其视为一个谜团。

我将从我所见到的现象开始，对此发表一些评论，然后转向训练方法，最后介绍一些你可以期待的锻炼，以使你的背部非常柔软。

解释这一切的最好方法是借用真实人物的图片。

**图 A**
![](/images/Image346.jpg){width="141" height="200"}
这个女孩的腰相当柔软。没错。然而，仔细观察，你会发现这个弯曲覆盖了许多椎骨。这个弯曲甚至延伸到了肋骨后面的椎骨，而且身体的前面呈现出非常平滑的曲线。一些椎骨每个都移动了一个小角度，使得背部呈现出这种平滑的曲线，这看起来非常优雅（在我看来）。这种弯曲是通过女孩用双脚相对靠近地抓住膝盖，将头仰后看向地板，然后将头拉向臀部/大腿，使头部靠近了臀部/大腿，从而形成的。

**图 B**
![](/images/Image347.jpg){width="159" height="200"}
这是与 A 显著不同的一个姿势。请注意，背部不再具有良好的曲线。弯曲是由下背部区域的几个椎骨完成的。肋骨后面的上背部几乎是笔直的。有一个原因。她弯曲了背部以使双手触及地板。她没有将头部拉到大腿上，而是向下伸展。她本可以更多地在臀部处旋转，但她只是允许她的一小部分背椎骨弯曲得更多。她采取的姿势方式保持了上背部（胸腰）的笔直。

**图 C**
![](/images/Image348.jpg){width="168" height="200"}
这是一个典型的近距离弯曲示范。与 B 相比，这是在下背部区域的几个椎骨处更紧密的弯曲，但上背部是笔直的，肋骨完全没有弯曲。这个姿势的起始方式与B相同，但她想要将头穿过大腿。她抓住膝盖处的腿，并从图 B 的位置拉进来。注意她的臀部已经更多地旋转。此外，承受弯曲的几个椎骨必须具有比图 B 中更大的角度运动。由于她的臀部紧贴着背部，所以不可能获得更紧密的弯曲。

柔软的背部在各个椎骨处具有很大的弯曲能力。很明显，最容易弯曲的部位是下背部，因为那里没有限制。背部向上移动，肋骨开始限制角度运动。

从中我们可以学到什么？显然，背部可以变得异常灵活，并产生优美的弯曲。在弯曲过程中，椎骨可以移动到极端角度。我在这里应该指出，上述的位置都是站立的后弯姿势。为了保持平衡，需要保持平衡，以防止摔倒，正如您在 B 中所看到的，需要很多肌肉控制。

当然，使用胸部或肘部接触地面时，背部会在更舒适的位置弯曲。我将解释为什么我会这样说。

**图 D**
![](/images/Image349.jpg){width="251" height="200"}
在这里，柔术演员的胸部紧贴地板，双脚拉到肩膀处。她的身体越多接触地板，她就会感到越舒适。下背部的椎骨提供了相当大的角度，以完成这个姿势。与站立姿势不同，这里不需要平衡，因此背部会放松到最舒适的位置。

**图 E**
![](/images/Image350.jpg){width="302" height="200"}
图 E 有一些相似之处，但这里出现了一种叠加效果，这很有趣。柔术演员躺在桌子上，她的重量承受在胸部上方的乳房区域。只有很小一部分身体靠在桌子上。在这张图片中，由于腿部悬空，她的背部没有像图 D 中那样弯曲。非常有趣的事情发生了！请注意，弯曲已经移到了更高的椎骨，以允许双腿将座位拉向地板！因此，她的背部简单地在背部的最舒适部位一些不同椎骨的提供了实现弯曲的角度。

**图 F**
![](/images/Image351.jpg){width="247" height="200"}
图 F 展示了柔术演员的一个有趣的弯曲。背部底部有一定角度，但她的椎骨在肋骨区域上部也有一些角度。

**总结**

当背部变得越来越柔软时，它将适应柔术演员所采取的姿势要求。如果柔术演员对自己的身体保持严格的肌肉控制，它不会改变椎骨的角度。然而，当肌肉放松时，背部将在最舒适的椎骨处弯曲以适应场合。在肋骨区域弯曲背部相对较难，这些椎骨之间不会产生大的角度运动。相对而言，在下部椎骨弯曲背部会比较容易，可以实现相当大的椎骨之间角度运动。

**以下是一系列共6张图片，展示了站立后弯姿势的不同阶段。**

**图 G**
![](/images/Image352.jpg){width="216" height="200"}
在图 G 中，柔术演员在髋部前倾。在这个过程中，她弯曲了背部。这使得她的重量保持在提供平衡的双脚上。

**图 H**
![](/images/Image353.jpg){width="214" height="200"}
在图 H 中，随着弯曲的继续，柔术演员让下背部承担了所有的弯曲运动，同时控制着保持笔直的上背部。为了保持平衡，她用髋部向前倾斜。

**图 I**
![](/images/Image354.jpg){width="271" height="200"}
在图 I 中，上半身仍然保持笔直，这要归功于她的控制。下部椎骨继续通过增加少数几个椎骨的角度位移来吸收弯曲。产生“弯曲”的椎骨在极少数几个椎骨上的角度超过了90度，表现出很大的灵活性。背部是你身体结构中令人惊叹的一部分，正如同你可以极端弯曲手指那样！现在，继续下面的三张图片。

**图 J**
![](/images/Image355.jpg){width="265" height="200"}
继续弯曲，她现在在髋部旋转，如图 J 所示，并将头部放在大腿后面。请注意，由于身体重心朝向腿部，她的腿部更加笔直。

**图 K**
![](/images/Image356.jpg){width="191" height="200"}
与后弯姿势常见的情况一样，如图 K 所示，她抓住了一条腿，就在膝盖上方，而没有增加图片 J 中已有的弯曲。一旦抓住一条腿，她就有了稳定的支撑基础，现在可以抓住另一条腿，然后将身体拉到最终的位置，如图 L 所示。

**图 L**
![](/images/Image357.jpg){width="220" height="200"}
关于图 L 需要注意的是，她的头部位于大腿上方，肩膀大约位于臀部和膝盖之间。这意味着弯曲是由一些下背椎骨完成的。与早期的图片相比，上背部的原始笔直状态保持不变。她的臀部牢牢地靠在背部，位于肋骨下部。抓住膝盖上方会使双腿锁定。如果抓住膝盖下方，膝盖会更容易弯曲。

这是一个经典的入门动作，可以完成完美的后弯，头部位于大腿之间。如果你练习的话，以后也能够做到这一点！

现在，让我们来看一些不同的姿势，并附上一些评论！

**图 M**
![](/images/Image358.jpg){width="176" height="200"}
图 M 显示头部抬高，肩膀与腿的位置仅略低于臀部。承受弯曲角度的椎骨位于她背部相对较高的位置。

**图 N**
![](/images/Image359.jpg){width="169" height="200"}
图 N 也非常令人印象深刻。柔术演员在她背部最低部分的椎骨处弯曲。比图片 M 还要低。她的肩膀在腿上的位置明显比 M 低。

**图 O**
![](/images/Image360.jpg){width="183" height="200"}
图片 O 非常有趣。首先，这位女孩有着壮硕的肋骨，尽管有一些肋骨显露出来，但女孩并不是太瘦。但她的臀部几乎没有任何脂肪！背部呈现出美妙的弯曲，但缺乏臀部脂肪使得这个姿势变得不寻常。更重要的是，这个姿势看起来不够紧凑，因为她的臀部不足以与背部接触。

所以这就是后弯。这是经典柔术演员姿势之一，因为大多数人可以前倾弯曲触摸脚尖，但很少有人能够做后弯。但是，背部及其椎骨可以弯曲得非常多，甚至超出你的想象。相邻的几个椎骨每个都可以实现相当大的角度运动，使其看起来几乎像是断裂的背部外观。柔术演员通过锻炼来增加关节的角度运动，从而能够采取其他人认为惊人的姿势。希望这个见解和解释能让你对通过锻炼使椎骨获得很大角度运动的背部能力有些了解。这种知识将进而使你在将下部椎骨弯曲成后弯时获得信心，并允许你将自己的椎骨弯曲到比以前想象的更大角度。

现在换一个后弯的例子。这次是另一个起始姿态。

**图 A**
![](/images/Image361.jpg){width="203" height="200"}
对于她进入后弯姿势的方法（图 A），女孩在髋部前倾。这通常是保持平衡的良好起点。在这一点上，我应该说后弯姿势不应该匆忙进行。它应该是一个经过深思熟虑和缓慢移动的动作。背部深度弯曲，椎骨在下背部提供了很大的角度运动。头部向后倾斜，直到后脑勺触碰到座位。这锁定在一个稳定位置上。

**图 B**
![](/images/Image362.jpg){width="167" height="200"}
从这个位置开始，髋部的前倾逐渐减少（图 B），但背部保持弯曲。随着前倾的减小，头部缓慢地沿着座位的轮廓滑下，髋部的前倾逐渐消失。背部的弯曲尽可能保持紧凑，随着运动的进行，不同的椎骨会改变其角度运动。

**图 C**
![](/images/Image363.jpg){width="143" height="200"}
与 A 和 B 图相比，图 C 将展示这个动作。

**图 D**
![](/images/Image364.jpg){width="186" height="200"}
现在膝盖处抓住双腿，就像图片 D 所示，以获得稳定的基础，髋部的旋转动作将肩膀拉到座位以下。然后使用双臂将弯曲程度拉近，直到肩膀接触到腿的后部，臀部靠在背部。

**图 E1**
![](/images/Image365.jpg){width="195" height="200"}
If the feet were reasonably apart for this bend then the head will be
through the thighs as at Picture E. In this position there is a
reasonable amount of pull force on the arms and hands and another option
may be preferred as follows.

**图 F1**
![](/images/Image366.jpg){width="149" height="200"}
If the feet were nearer together for the bend, from Picture D position
and the subsequent hip pivot took place the arms may be clasped in front
of the knees and the head is against the back of the knees as picture F.
Once the hands are clasped there is no pull on the arms. (But there is
more to come!!).

**图 E2**
![](/images/Image367.jpg){width="185" height="200"}
This is an alternative continuation from Picture D. From the D Picture
position the hip pivot takes place and one leg only is grasped at the
knee. See Picture E2.

**图 E3**
![](/images/Image368.jpg){width="171" height="200"}
Holding the one leg, the pull in brings the head outside the leg and the
lower back vertebrae now have an angular movement to the side as well as
to the rear as the head takes position as Picture E3. After a pause
holding that position, the inside hand transfers to the other leg. The
head is now taken from outside one leg across the back and pulled to
outside the other leg.

**图 F**
![](/images/Image369.jpg){width="176" height="200"}
Following that, the head is returned to center as previous picture E1 or
F1. This is very interesting in that the girl has pivoted at the hips to
an amazing extent and her head is between her knees. The back bend is
good but it is the hip socket movement that is impressive.

## Standing back bends

The standing back bend is not an easy pose to get yourself into. The
problem with it is that you are standing and then instead of forward
bending which is natural you must reverse the bend. For forward bends
the shape of the foot provides good leverage to maintain balance. The
leg goes down to the foot and then the toes are some distance ahead of
the leg pivot point. Any tendency to overbalance is corrected by
pressure on the toes.

During a backbend the tendency to go off balance cannot be corrected
easily because the toes point the wrong way. As you commence a standing
back bend you must, therefore, make sure that the body is maintaining
pressure on the toes by slight overbalance forward. This is the reason
for pivot forward of the hips at the initial stage of the bend. It is
fair to comment that the brain senses the need for forward balance and
tends to tense up muscles in case of problems with this un-natural
action.

It is for that reason that I never attempt to teach a standing backbend
until the trainee has an exceptionally supple and therefore confident
back bend. I know that others teach back bends far too early (in my
opinion). I will show the effect.

## Bad Training Technique

**图 G1**
![](/images/Image370.jpg){width="185" height="200"}
This would be an often taught way of entering a back bend. First, to a
bridge as Picture G1;

**图 G2**
![](/images/Image371.jpg){width="162" height="200"}
then walk the hands to the feet as picture G2;

**图 G3**
![](/images/Image372.jpg){width="142" height="200"}
then grasp the ankles as picture G3. All very difficult and every part
of the way there is strain. The coach expects the girl to increase her
back flexibility by tightening the bend from this position. This is a
big ask.

**图 G3a**
![](/images/Image373.jpg){width="140" height="200"}
Then what comes next? The girl has a fragile hold on her ankles and
little stability and not great back flexibility as picture G3a. To try
to increase flexibility the coach sets the task of getting the hands up
to the knees so that the bend will become tighter.

**图 G4**
![](/images/Image374.jpg){width="151" height="200"}
The poor girl has to work the hands up the legs using finger action one
hand at a time as picture G4 and all the time with bent knees because
her back is not that flexible.

Try standing with the knees bent and see how much work you must do to
stay balanced. Now imagine that you were in a back bend with knees bent.
A totally unbalanced position with a tense body. So, the inevitable
happens. She falls over, injures herself or...

**图 G5**
![](/images/Image375.jpg){width="203" height="200"}
Because of lack of progress (which is understandable) the coach
determines that he will help out the student by grasping her body and
holding pressure on her back. The girl now has the legs more straight
because coach is taking a lot of the weight. The girl can relax because
coach is holding her and will not let her fall so she can work her hands
higher up the legs as picture G5.

I do not think this style is any good at all and will tell you my method
later.

The totally assisted method of teaching a back bend!

**图 H1 Picture H2 Picture H3**

<div class="img-group">

![](/images/Image376.jpg){width="200" height="200"}
![](/images/Image377.jpg){width="162" height="200"}
![](/images/Image378.jpg){width="175" height="200"}

</div>

This is an actual series of pictures (H1 through H3) of one method a
coach uses to get the trainee contortionist into a back bend. The girl
does a loose bridge and is forced into the positions. When she is pulled
into the position the coach wants the girl is told to hold position and
is let go, something that the assistant never should do.

In my opinion this is a training method that does not produce confidence
and is totally incorrect. To me it is vitally important that the
contortionist trainee gets there in a much more friendly manner and I
will tell you all about what I shall get you to do to achieve much
better and quicker results. Not earlier than then the assisted
stretching should commence.

The back is a complex part of the body. But, not only is it complex, it
has an amazing ability to bend. This is achieved by angular change
between adjacent vertebrae. That angle change can be in any direction
and can be considerable. It is the muscles in the back that control any
angular change in vertebrae.

## Our training methods.

For us it is important to have the trainee in positions where there is
minimum strain and this will always be in a comfortable position where
there is a minimum balance requirement. As confidence grows and
flexibility improves more complex positions will be within the capacity
of the student. It is important to stay away from difficult balance
positions at the early stages.

### Initial back bending training

There are two individually different starting positions and they may be
used alone or used in combination. Some trainees can more easily do one
of the start positions than the other and in this case it is far better
to simply do the easy one for a time until confidence has grown and the
other position introduced. The two starting positions are:

- On the floor lying on the side
- On the floor lying on the tummy

In both of these positions there is no balance required and since both
are on the floor the student has no fears about falling over. They can
also be carried out assisted.

### Exercise lying on the side

This exercise could not be simpler. The student is on the floor on her
side and does the exercise positions that follow.

**Position LBB1**
![](/images/Image379.jpg){width="239" height="150"}
Position LBB1 is the start position and the student is in a comfortable
position on the floor with legs spread for stability. One foot is
grasped and pulled to tighten the bend.

**Position LBB2**
![](/images/Image380.jpg){width="241" height="156"}
As the back gets more flexible the foot can be pulled over the shoulder
(LBB2) and as this occurs the face slides along the outside of the leg.
Repeats are done and leg pulls are done with each leg. Once the leg
passes the shoulder it is time to introduce a minor change in the
exercise because the back is getting more supple and this needs to be
exploited.

Positon LBB3
![](/images/Image381.jpg){width="230" height="184"}
LBB3 is the third stage of this exercise and the contortion trainee
grasps both feet at the same time and pulls both feet down over the
shoulders. Once she can get both feet to her shoulders there is little
value in continuing this exercise.

On the floor lying on the tummy.

Again, this exercise could not be simpler. The student is on the floor
on her tummy and does the exercise positions that follow.

Posiotion TBB1
![](/images/Image382.jpg){width="212" height="84"}
Position TBB1 is the start and the student arches the back, assisted by
the hands pushing.

**Position TBB2**
![](/images/Image383.jpg){width="180" height="86"}
The feet are raised as TBB2 and the student tries to get the feet to the
shoulders.

**Position TBB3**
![](/images/Image384.jpg){width="150" height="84"}
When this is achieved she can progress to TBB3 where she will be able to
grasp each foot (one at a time) and pull it. Eventually the back will
become more supple and the student will get the foot over the shoulder
at which time a new exercise providing a challenge needs to be given.

Once the student is able to easily get each foot over her shoulder doing
either the side back bend (SBB series) or the tummy back bend (TBB
series) it is time to change and provide a greater challenge. SBB and
TBB may be given at the same time to provide variation.

### Intermediate back bend training

To start on this training the student must be able to do SBB and TBB and
get both feet to the shoulders at the same time. The heels of the feet
must actually be in front of the shoulders or the next exercises will be
rather difficult. This intermediate training comprises two different
exercises:

- Kneeling on the floor with a backbend
- On the tummy with backbend

Kneeling on the floor and back bend. Being a kneeling pose any backbend
will cause no overbalance difficulty so the student will be quite
confident and, therefore, relaxed about the position. The vertebrae will
be achieving big angular change during this exercise.

**Position KBB1**
![](/images/Image385.jpg){width="237" height="200"}
At position KBB1 the student kneels, legs apart and backbends to grasp
the feet. At that point there is total stability so the student can
relax in confidence.

**Position KBB2**
![](/images/Image386.jpg){width="230" height="200"}
The exercise is to move the head towards "between the thighs" and as
flexibility is improved the student will be able to get the hands to the
ankles as at position KBB2.

**Position KBB3**
![](/images/Image387.jpg){width="209" height="200"}
With more and more exercising the student will be able to relax while
doing this bend because there is no balance required and the base is
extremely stable. As practice in this exercise is gained, the vertebrae
will achieve greater angular deflection and the bend will tighten
significantly. This will allow the student to move the hands further and
further along the legs towards the knees as KBB3. In time the hands will
be able to grasp in front of the knees.

### On the tummy with backbend

This is a continuation of the On the floor lying on the tummy exercise
TBB but is more advanced.

**Position ATB1**
![](/images/Image388.jpg){width="246" height="200"}
Previously the student was able to get the foot to the shoulder. Now
that foot is grasped and pulled down towards the floor as ATB1.

**Position ATB2**
![](/images/Image389.jpg){width="320" height="166"}
The rear leg stays stretched to the rear and the toes of this foot
should remain in contact with the floor. As the student becomes more
flexible in the back the front foot will touch the floor as ATB2.

### Time to move on

By this stage the student has a back with good flexibility and a new
exercise is introduced - the layover.

Again, the exercise does not require balance as it is done on the chest.
This allows relaxation by the student and the ability to achieve much
greater flexibility.

### Layover from chest on chair or couch.

The aim is to achieve the maximum back bend. This will be achieved from
a comfortable chest position on a comfortable base. The legs are allowed
to drape over the shoulders and the natural weight of the legs and seat
tighten the bend.

**Position CLO1**
![](/images/Image390.jpg){width="159" height="200"}
Entry to start position is achieved by a simple back bend to the chair
(or couch) as at picture CLO1. Early in the bend contact with the chair
will be made by the hands and they take a support role getting into the
start position.

**Position CLO2**
![](/images/Image391.jpg){width="224" height="200"}
It is important that the student gets properly into the start position
and she should wriggle herself (position CLO2) until the exact position
of chest, chin, arms and hands for the start position is achieved.

**Position CLO3**
![](/images/Image291.jpg){width="289" height="200"}
The start position is seen in CLO3. Note that the chin is on the seat of
the chair as are the hands and that the hands are just in front of the
chin. The arms are in a position where they are providing maximum
support to stop any forward roll off the chair. This position is another
"comfort zone" one. I have deliberately chosen a furniture item that
the student will know well. Its surface is soft and comfortable and it
is relatively low to the ground. No balance is required and the student
will be able to relax while doing the exercise part.

**Position CLO4**
![](/images/Image392.jpg){width="203" height="200"}
Bring the legs over as in position CLO4. The toes can be pointed and
they should touch the floor. While most seats are low enough to allow
this an unusually high seat and student with short legs may need
suitably sized cushions placed on the floor so that the toes can touch
this and take load if needed because this is the "rest" position.

**Position CLO5**
![](/images/Image393.jpg){width="320" height="144"}
Both legs are then raised as in position CLO5 and the bend in the back
tightens.

**Position CLO6**
![](/images/Image394.jpg){width="203" height="200"}
From this position one leg is brought back into position as shown in
position CLO6 and then returned to position as CLO5. Then the other leg
is taken through the same motion. This continuously performed "cycling
type" motion will tighten the bend considerably and after the specified
number of cycling actions the student returns to the rest position as in
CLO4.

This exercise will have a large number of repetitions resting in CLO4
between them. As the student does more and more of this exercise she
will start to feel her seat make contact with her upper back from time
to time.

At this stage she will be able to relax and if she allows the weight of
the legs and seat to take over while in the position of picture CLO4 she
will, in time, be able to get her seat to touch her own back and rest in
the position.

This exercise will have prepared the back for any tight bending. Now
that the student is very flexible in the back it is time to introduce
other positions where some balance is required. For example, a standing
back bend would now be introduced because the back is supple and only
the standing balance will be new.

<span class="important">Utilizing the elbow stand for back bending.</span> Although a hand stand
requires considerable balance a stand done on the forearms (elbow stand)
is relatively easy. The elbow stand is a very useful balance position
because considerable back bending can be carried out in this balance.

### Position for an elbow stand.

**Position EST1**
![](/images/Image395.jpg){width="216" height="200"}
The best initial position to get started with an elbow stand is shown in
position EST1. It is entered from a backbend to hands dropping to
elbows. Note that the elbows are a little wider apart than the shoulders
and the forearms are on the floor with the fingers spread and flat on
the floor. The upper arms can be vertical or a little off vertical
depending on the position of the body. The feet are firmly on the floor.

**Position EST2**
![](/images/Image396.jpg){width="199" height="200"}
Now raise the head and arch the back while you lift onto tiptoes as
picture EST2. The toes will be taking very little weight at this stage.
Raise the head a little more and the feet will come off the floor.

**Position EST3**
![](/images/Image397.jpg){width="158" height="200"}
The position EST3 should be held. For a start the feet will return to
touch the floor but the aim is to remain on the elbows without feet
contact and this balance will quickly be mastered.

### A few elbow stand positions in combination with back bends

1\. A simple exercise.

Starting from EST1. Bring one foot back to the hands and grasp it with
both hands. This is still a very stable position because the two elbows
and foot make the base triangle.

**Position SX01**
![](/images/Image398.jpg){width="150" height="200"}
Raise one foot from the floor bending the knee and getting to position
SX01 ..

**Position SX02**
![](/images/Image399.jpg){width="97" height="199"}
Raise the leg to vertical pointing the foot as position SX02\\85.

**Position SX03**
![](/images/Image400.jpg){width="287" height="200"}
Now bring the leg rearwards towards the floor to the equivalent of the
splits position. SX03\\85

From the SX03 position return the leg back to alongside the other foot
on the floor.

In reality, this is not very much of an elbow stand balance because
there is always the foot on the floor as the triangle base and this
makes the position very stable. The exercise is, however, a good starter
to more difficult elbow stand exercises. The higher you raise the head
the tighter will be the back bend. It is also possible for a girl with a
good over split to touch the floor with the toes of the rear foot.

2\. Another simple exercise.

Starting from EST1. This time raise both feet off the floor at the same
time.

**Position SX11**
![](/images/Image401.jpg){width="182" height="200"}
See position SX11. For a start this may be more easily done if the feet
are brought in so that they are against the head. This provides a little
easier balance. At this stage you have a true elbow balance because the
feet are off the floor and the balance is achieved from the elbows along
to the hands.

**Position SX12**
![](/images/Image402.jpg){width="320" height="188"}
Slowly raise the feet while maintaining balance and have the legs
parallel with the floor as position SX12.

**Position SX13**
![](/images/Image403.jpg){width="176" height="200"}
Continue to raise the legs higher as in position SX13.

**Position SX14**
![](/images/Image404.jpg){width="130" height="200"}
Now you can bend each leg in turn so that the foot touches the head as
in position SX14.

**Position SX11**
![](/images/Image401.jpg){width="182" height="200"}
Return the legs to the floor by bringing them down alongside the face as
in position SX11 on the way to the floor.

3\. A more advanced exercise.

**Position EST1**
![](/images/Image395.jpg){width="216" height="200"}
Starting from EST1. This being the normal start position.

**Position AEX32**
![](/images/Image399.jpg){width="97" height="199"}
Grasp one foot then raise the head reasonably high and this will tighten
the bend then raise the other leg to the vertical as in position AEX32.

**Position AEX33**
![](/images/Image405.jpg){width="151" height="200"}
Let go the foot and bring this leg up to the top leg but to assist the
balance bend at the knee as AEX33.

**Position AEX34**
![](/images/Image406.jpg){width="176" height="200"}
Finally, bring the feet down to parallel the floor and sit on the head
as the back bends more and more as AEX34. Return the feet to the start
position.

You have seen some of the lovely results that you will achieve following
