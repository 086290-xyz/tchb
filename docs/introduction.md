# Introduction

Ever wondered how those incredible contortionists and acrobats you've
seen on TV or at the circus can do their fantastic poses or how yogis
can move their bodies in a way that you never thought was possible and
how they feel? Ever wanted to be able to do it yourself? Here's the
chance. It might take "time, blood, sweat and tears", but you will get
there with the exercises you'll find here if you just give it some time
every day.

The exercises used in contortion (and yoga as well) is used by various
circus artists, dancers, gymnasts and many others. It is a wonderful
feeling to be able to move the body without any limitations and the goal
with this page is to show you how to do it and most important: how to
get there. Having practiced myself as well as trained others me and my
co-authors have noticed that much of this is kept almost like a trade
secret and believe it shouldn't be. An other reason is that there are
many "schools", more or less experimental, that also should be
mentioned as they can have the effect that you search for, but can't
find. There can also be the situation where you don't have a coach or
school in your area. In the process of writing and publishing previous
versions of this handbook me and my co-authors have received numerous of
mails from all parts of the world. We want to share that experience as
well as it might be of use for you in your training. So one of the most
important reasons that this handbook is published is simply: we don't
want the knowledge to be lost. It should be available everywhere.

To tell the truth exercising to improve your strength and flexibility
the way contortionists, dancers, gymnasts and many others do isn't as
difficult as it seems - nor is it dangerous (as some may believe when
they see it). A common question is if it hurts and for example, if a
dislocation of a joint hurts or has permanent side effects. The answer
to that is simple: it doesn't hurt and there are no negative permanent
side effects. It is uncomfortable in the beginning, but you feel the
discomfort lesser for each time you do the exercises and sometimes even
each time you repeat an exercise while you carry out the schedule. The
more you exercise the more pleasant it feels. Any position you will see
feels natural and will feel the same to you if you follow the
instructions and give it some time. Just to give an example I can tell
you how it feels to dislocate the shoulder in a proper way when you are
used to it. First you feel something like a crack or click and then you
can feel the joint slide out of the socket. The feeling is amazing,
because everything happens inside you and it's like a tickling
sensation. It doesn't hurt for a second. Instead it feels like the
bones inside were swimming around in a mass of gelly. That is probably
the best description. Does it sound terrible? I hope it doesn't,
because it isn't. Practice will give you exactly that feeling, a body
that is able to move in any way you wish, a great portion of
satisfaction and as a bonus you'll stay healthy. So as you can
understand this can be a natural *way of living and I hope it will be for you too*. A [backbend (or even backfold)](./backinfo) that might
look impossible or even freaky to you will in time feel like any natural
move and be very enjoyable to do. Just observe any member of the animal
kingdom. Every animal exercises every day and they instinctively know
that the secret of a long and healthy life is a flexible spine. Any part
of the body that is not continually used will eventually cease to
function. Most people don't stretch, do yoga or contort and maybe
there's the key to why many have trouble with their spines and other
health issues connected to bad posture and an unhealthy and poorly
trained spine. Anyone, including you, can become good if you only take
your time and believe that you will get there one day, because it's
much about believing and giving it time. For some it will take no time
at all, but some will have to struggle a little bit, maybe because
you've lost some of your flexibility because of age. Something that is
recommended is to stretch daily for around a month before you start
doing these exercises. Easier yoga asanas like the sun greeting are
recommend warmly since it will give you the basic flexibility and
strenght needed to do the exercises without struggling too much, but
normal stretching is enough. Also it's worth mentioning that yoga is
<span class="underline">very</span> similar to contortion.

There are many benefits with doing contortion. Some of the most
important are

- that you probably will be one of those that won't suffer of
  osteoarthritis when you get old. Amongst people who are not
  practicing activities like yoga or contortion, only one in fifty
  will escape some form of rheumatic or arthritic complaint in their
  lifetime.
- that when you get old you'll most likely look much younger than
  most people in your age.
- that medical surveys show that contortionists and yogis not only has
  a great resistance to every day complaints, pain and disease, but
  their general health is excellent and they live considerably longer
  than folks in any other professions.
- that if you suffer from hyper mobility or other health issues like
  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is a disorder of the connective
  tissue, you will most likely get results much quicker than a healthy
  person, but at the same time feel less of the symptoms. If you or
  other members of your family have suffered from one or many
  dislocations you're most likely having similar health issues and
  should learn to do controlled dislocations and fully master the
  exercise schedule. How people are built also decides how far it's
  possible to go or how much, but most can do all of the exercises.
  Many times it only means that it will take longer to learn to do
  some things while others come easily. Most important is to practice
  daily. For me practicing yoga and contortion sport has meant
  stopping the progress of EDS completely with all of it's symptoms.
- that your strenght will improve
- that your endurance will improve
- that your pain treshold will improve remarcably
- that your range of movement will improve dramatically
- that your memory and concentration will improve
- that this is the most natural and inexpensive way of exercising that
  exists. It won't cost you a penny. All you need is yourself, some
  space and your furniture.
- that this natural and inexpensive way of exercising can get you
  quite wealthy as a good contortionist usually earns €60000 a year
  and a contortion model earns €1000+ per shot. Good contortionists
  are attractive on the market and therefore earn quite well. Very
  often ex-contortionists continue their careers becoming contortion
  coaches or start their own schools and earn quite well from this.
- that if you practice together with your partner it will most likely
  make you much closer to eachother.
- that it [increases and improves the sex life remarcably](./lovemaking)
- that you can do almost anything while practicing, like watching TV,
  reading books, surf the web or even wash the dishes while practicing
  a position. The reason is very often that they enjoy doing yoga or
  contortion very much once they manage the first exercises or, if you
  prefere to use the yoga vocabulary, asanas.
- that many asanas/poses produce very intence sensations that can be
  comparable to those in sexual life. You will be addicted at once or
  very soon!

## Who can practice?

Anyone that is serious, willing to put enough time and has patience.
Some say that any over the age of 25 years shouldn't start contorting.
Others refuse to train men, because they considered as good as women (or
maybe the coach doesn't like to train men due to other issues not
needed to be mentioned here?). Let's kill those myths. There are men
that are 55 years old and can do many of the poses and exercises on
these pages and the only difference between a man starting in the middle
age and for example a 20 year old woman that has started in her
childhood is that it takes him longer time to be successful with the
same things she is in short time.

## What types of contortionists are there?

Either a contortionist is are a "frontbender" or a "backbender" and
all the facets of the act are built on these movements and the ability
to hyperextend or hyperflex the spine. The frontbender is many times the
"funny man" as he can take up ludicrous positions and perform amusing
feats like placing the feet around the neck while standing on one hand.
This doesn't mean that men can't be good backbenders. There are men
that can do better backbends than any woman and to know whether you're
one of them the only way to find out is to do the exercises and in time
see. In contrast to the frontbender the backbender or "posturer" has a
more serious act. It's often a woman, but as I said it doesn't have to
be like that. The backbender performs speciality acts or incorporates
the abilities into a graceful dance routine.

To get back to the question who can do this the answer is, as you can
see, anyone. What makes the difference is that to be good you have to
practice daily and the more the better. One day of inactivity will
result in a marked stiffening of the joints. However this is something
that happens in any type of activity. Practicing is the key to being
good (and avoiding cigarettes, alcohol and other poisons).

So why not begin? You don't know what you've been missing.

## How much practice do I need?

First of all let me point out that this is VERY individual and also
depends on what goals you set. A contortionist *can* practice for around
three hours daily or even more. Don't get scared of this. You decide
the amount of training and who said that you want to be a contortionist?
Even if you want to practice for three hours it can be one hour in the
morning, one during the day and one in the evening before going to bed.
As you can see a good way can be to divide up the exercising so that you
do them during the day, for example a set of exercises in the morning,
while having lunch, after getting home and before going to bed ans
different exercises in the different blocks. The alternative with
dividing up the practicing will help you to keep the maximum possible
suppleness.You'll soon find out that you can do many of the exercises
while doing something else like... 

<div class="img-group">

![](/images/Exerci1.jpg){width="227" height="138"}
![](/images/Exerci2.gif){width="210" height="138"}

</div>

...when watching TV, reading a book... 

![](/images/Image408.jpg){width="199" height="197"}

...or even chatting on the internet and that you'll be comfortable and
enjoy doing it at all times. As with everything the more you do it the
better and then why not combining it with other things you have to do?
It will definately make the practicing much more interesting, so don't
be afraid of having fun. If you have done all the exercises and feel
that you have more time then try to do them over again. You will be
amazed over how much easier it will be. Repeats are the secret to become
and stay real supple. You also build strenght in the muscles this way.

But again, as I said before, your set goals also have a lot to say and
it can be well enough with an hour daily to increase the overall
flexibility, even if it won't make you a contortionist. Most likely
you'll end up practicing for more, because you'll enjoy it very much.
However it's important to point out that you should do the exercises
daily if you want any results, even if you only do that hour each day
(and around one hour is what you should begin with). Remember that
loosing one day of exercising means that it can take up to one week to
reach the same level of flexibility. The same is if you miss out a weeks
exercises. It can take a month to reach the same level. So if you can't
set aside some time each day to exercise don't start practicing at all
(and miss the best experience of your life)!

No matter who you are if you only do what's told in the instructions
you will be able to do most or everything shown and you'll be hooked in
no time. Already after one week you will see results and be amazed. The
most interesting thing you'll find out quick is that your brain won't
understand what's happening. Never underestimate the strength of the
mind! If you close your eyes and do a backbend or split or which
position you want to do you'll be amazed and pleased over that you can
do it so well and maybe how deep it is the second you open your eyes.
That gives an extreme rush and is one reason why most get addicted. Only
this feeling is something making it worth to try. Depending on if the
exercises are carried out according to the instructions, your age,
suppleness/stiffness and if you train daily it's estimated to take
around 3-12 months for you to be able to place your feet on either side
of your head, from a prone position, but of course the younger you are
when you start, the easier it will be.

## Some about food 

Someone once said that eating is believing and it maybe sounds silly,
but it's the truth. There are as many recommendations on what to eat as
ways to train. Some say become a vegetarian, but I don't agree.

You can continue to eat meat, but not as much as before and avoid fat as
much as possible. That means continue eating what you ate before, but in
normal proportions and with a little bit more awareness of what you eat.
Listen to your body and most important of all eat healthy. If your body
asks for fruits, eat fruits and so on. You'll also soon find out that
you'll quite automaticly change your habits.

Something I recommend is to eat fruits, hazelnuts and a cup of tea for
breakfast. For lunch eggs and some fruits and to dinner always something
cooked like meat or fish, root-crops/- fruits and some fruits. You can
use all kinds of spices, but try to avoid salt as much as possible (this
will be difficult in the beginning, but after some time you won't want
salt to any kind of food, because it will taste awful). Except for that
eat berries, sea food and honey. Also try <strong><span class="underline">not</span></strong> to eat
for 1-2 hours before you exercise. Doing a backbend or a frontbend with
a full stomach isn't recommended and can result in you throwing up.
Also try not to drink alcohol and absolutely never smoke. If you start
to train and drink alcohole (even if not a big amount) or smoke just one
cigarette you will feel that your training will feel more difficult and
you'll maybe not have the same range of movement the next day.

The result of this will be that you'll loose weight to what was your
teenager average weight, the blood preasure will get lower and the same
with the colesterole. You will feel much better, think much better and
it's much easier to practice.

The eating habits above remind much of what different yoga books
recommend and contortion *is* very similar to yoga. The same food was
also eaten by people in the stone age as well as today by the people on
the island of Kitava where the living conditions are similar to the ones
in the stone age. Many times the people there are very strong, flexible
and your average day heart disease doesn't exist there. The difference
to what I mentioned above, except for the alcohol, is that they also
avoid sugar, milk or cheese.

However in the end you decide what to eat and drink and these were only
some healthy thoughts and recommendations to help you on the way. One
thing is important though: DON'T EAT MORE THAN NOW AND NOT TOO MUCH!!!!
*The exercises will make you hungry, but that doesn't mean you need to eat more.*

## Clothing and enviroment

There are many different clothes to wear while practicing, but the rule
(depending on where you are) is the less the better. To wear loose
fitting attire is often recommended, but unitards or catsuits are much
better and work very well both for men and women. Most dancers,
contortionists and gymnasts wear them and they give many benefits
compared to other clothes when fitted perfectly to your body.

- they aren't restricting, but more alike a second skin and that is
  very important, because nothing then will disturb you in your
  practicing or make moves difficult or sometimes even impossible
  (it's important that the unitard is fitted perfectly to your body)
- they keep all of you warm if they don't "breathe" too much (latex
  and PVC are excellent materials for this purpose, something that
  numerous mails confirm). The downside is that you sweat a lot, but
  you still stay warm and don't risk any injury!
- they will let you slide into the different positions (which
  sometimes is necessary) compared to loose fitting attire or bikinis.
  Especially if the unitard (or catsuit) is made in latex or PVC it
  will make practicing backbends, different splits and oversplits much
  easier, because there is nothing stopping you. Also working with the
  contortion barre and all other barres is made much simpler using a
  PVC catsuit. If a PVC or latex catsuit isn't available where you
  live other materials can do too, but it's important that they are
  slippery and tight fitting. Before buying, if possible, feel the
  material. The more slippery the better. If possible, of the same
  reasons, it's good if the feet are covered by the catsuit.

<div class="img-group">

![](/images/latex-fb1.jpg){width="161" height="266"}
![](/images/latex-split1.jpg){width="154" height="267"}

</div>

Jazz pants and a top, shorts, bikinis and similar, can also be good, but
they need to be tight fitting and if you use such attire the place where
you exercise MUST be well heated! Again it's important that your
clothes don't disturb you in the exercises or restrict your movement in
any way.

As this handbook isn't written for new beginners only, but also for
professionals, it's worth pointing out that your clothes also give a
great impression and can lift the act to a different level while
performing. Many times catsuits with metal or wet looks can be the
excellent choice as they don't restrict the movement, but also help the
audience to see you better if the lightning is poor or you want to use
various kinds of effects. Also they are cheap. In a circus tent or out
in the open it can be worth not to forget that you need to be warm.
It's better to be warm and sweat than freeze and risk injury due to
that the well-effects of the warm up wear off.

When it comes to footwear you should also invest in pointe shoes or
other shoes as pointing your feet as many exercises are more effective
when done en pointe. Many dancers, gymnasts and professionals heartily
recommend those made by Capezio. You'll find more information about it
in the [other leg exercises](./other_leg_exercises) page. There
has been quite many mails from ballet dancers recommending prolonged
daily wear of ballet boots while not dancing or exercising in order to
train balance, the feet's flexibility and strength and to be able to
stay en pointe for as long as needed. It may be true. See more about
that in the [ballet boots](./balletboots) page. However, if you're to
wear this type of apparel on a daily basis always remember to stretch
the feet, to do the point exercises, among those the ballet positions.
This has to be done daily in order to allow the feet to keep their
strength and flexibility. Otherwise prolonged wear (more than 5-6 hours
a day) may damage your feet.

Something that also has been mentioned in e-mails from Germany, The
Netherlands and, to my surprise, Russia are the positive effects of
combining contortion and rather extreme tight-lacing / corsetry. I have
received descriptions, pictures and videos from professionals using this
method, lacing their waist as much as 25 cm 24-7, except for toilet
needs, exercising and performance. The exercises they do are the
advanced ones from the schedule and according to what I can see the
contortion training makes it easier for them to tight-lace rather
extremely as well as the tight-lacing helps them to get more limber
faster and most have been able to fold their backs a little bit over a
year after beginning! One of the reasons can be that the corset
simulates the effect to the body of a deep backbend or a backfold where
the organs are very much compressed and displaced and the ability to
breathe deeply is reduced. The corset wearer's bodies has adapted to
this due to the constriction and therefore the positions involving
backbends are much easier to do than normally. As some corsets, so
called pipe-stems, lengthen the spine, this also makes it easier to bend
it in all directions. I haven't seen any documentation on this before,
so I keep this open for discussion.

Also the enviroment in the room can be important. Never have a cool
temperature in the room (less than 18 °C) while exercising. It's
obvious since it's very important to keep the well effects of the
warmup while exercising. Of course it's easier to breathe and not to
need to sweat while doing exercises in a cold room, but you risk
injuring yourself as the well-effects of the warm up wear off very
quickly. Again I would like to point out that you always should remember
to be warmed up before performing and if your performance is to last
longer periods always be properly clothed.

## How to follow the exercise schedule

Initially before stretching out there are some things you should do if
you want to get good results from the exercises and most important of
all, don't want to injure yourself.

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline">ALWAYS DO WARM UP BEFORE YOU START TO DO SOME SERIOUS STRETCHING!</p>

This is very important, no matter whether you can sit on your shoulders,
do the best oversplits in the world or are a new beginner. A good warm
up can be any activity that will make your blood circulate like running
around a little bit, maybe in stairs and then first doing the exercises
lightly stretching to where you can get without feeling that the muscles
get tense. This means no real stretching, but during several repeats you
go to the the most flexible position where you feel comfortable, but not
further! Many recommend doing the yoga sun greeting rapidly repeatedly
until you are warm. The warmups promote circulation, respiration and
general loosening of joint bindings.

<p style="text-align: center; color: red; font-weight: bold;">Any athlete, dancer, gymnast or contortionist injure themselves if they don't warm up - NO MATTER HOW GOOD THEY ARE!</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline">Without warming up you will most likely get hurt!</p>

Another thing worth to remember is that many things that you do during
the day can be done in a flexible way. Why not bend forward with legs
straight when you're going to tie your shoe laces or maybe chat, read
books or watch TV while in a split, oversplit or backbend, backfold when
you get there. You will feel very healthy of this and at the same time
you will prevent any loss of flexibility during the day. This will also
make you more ready for the more serious exercises. However don't
forget to stay warmed up. If you're not flexible at all before you
begin using these exercises I would recommend to do some easy stretching
exercises or easier yoga asanas for a month. Some basic flexibility
won't hurt and it will be much easier to do even the easiest exercise.

If you aren't strong in your back you will also need to to strenghten
it, so you can return to an upright position after a backbend. One way
is to lie on your back on the top of a gym horse, couch or bed with
someone sitting on your lower legs, with your upper body overhanging the
edge and bending back down and then up again. Another way is to lie
across two soft chairs supported by your shoulders and hips and flex
your back. Both these exercises will need someone to assist you
initially.

## Post warm up

After warming up you're ready to do some serious stretching. The
exercises are built up like a very easy looking program where the level
increases with the number of the exercises. Do all exercises till you
reach the most advanced exercises you can do for each group of muscles.
You will feel which exercises that correspond to which muscle group. If
you want to do all the exercises this will take approx 3 hours. As you
advance you can skip some of the easier preparing exercises, but always
ask us, or if you have one, your coach. Instead such exercises can be
used as a part of your warm up. If you are a newbie don't do more
advanced exercises than you can handle. Do the exercises you are good at
and those that are difficult, but that you still can manage to some
extent. They are supposed to be a challenge and will help you improve.
That's the way you get results. On the other hand if you go to fast and
do exercises that are far too difficult for you to handle you might end
up injuring yourself. 

The exercises are set so that the easiest come first and then the level
of advancement increases the further you go. Always begin from the first
exercise and work towards the more advanced. When you've succeeded with
the exercise you're doing then move along to the next exercise.
Continuing like that in time you will be able to do all of them and then
it's good to do as many of them as possible. After each session write
down which exercises you've done in a notebook. This way you'll know
what you've done the day before, but you'll also be able to see how
you're advancing.

The way to see whether you shouldn't do an exercise is that it's too
difficult to do. **Then** <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">don't do it- yet, </span> **but do do it when you're ready for it! Yes, I'm repeating myself, but this is very important and I don't want you to injure yourself!** The pictures are
to show how the exercises are to be done, but also to show how it will
look when maximum flexibility in the exercise is reached. Don't worry
if you can't do them as good as the persons in the pictures. Instead
use the most advanced pictures to set your goal. You will get there
sooner than you think.

Do not jerky actions. Try to stretch out as much as you can without
getting hurt or being uncomfortable. Don't forget that with the
exercises you are to achieve the maximum flexibility by stretching out
as much as possible so don't give up! You will get further sooner than
you expect. The 1-2-3-4-5 is a progressive stretch a little bit at each
count, then stay there counting 1-2-3-4-5 or if you're comfortable
until you feel the muscle being strained. Then release only a few
degrees to a resting position where it feels more comfortable or if
instructed to an initial position and continue the stretch from where
you were at the count of 5 the last time, but trying to get a bit
further while counting 1-2-3-4-5. In the last repeat try to stay as long
as possible in the position. Each repeat is a count of 1-2-3-4-5.

If you are lucky enough to have an assistant to stretch you (of course
always after warming up) relax while your assistant stretches you out
until it's not possible to go further. Do not try to counteract. Unless
otherwise instructed do the assisted stretches the same way as if you
were without an assistant, with the difference that the assistant will
hold you longer in the finishing position at the count of 5. In the
beginning when doing an exercise, assisted or not, or if you have been
able to stretch further than you've been able to do before it can hurt
while in the position. This is normal and will only last for around a
week or two. Then you can continue further and after you reached your
maximum flexibility you won't feel any pain at all when you stretch out
and you will be able to stay in any position for as long as you want
without any discomfort.

Don't "overdo" any exercise until you feel that you are in a so
advanced level that you can master it perfectly and see or feel that
you've achieved what is shown on the pictures. Let your own body set
the limits and instead of overdoing *do many repeats*. Repeats are the
key! 10-25 repeats are usually the best depending on your age, gender,
flexibility etc. The number of repeats in this case is a recommendation.
If it should be carried out 20 times and you carry it out 40 times, it
doesn't mean that you will get twice the flexibility and if you carry
it out 60 times you may find that your muscles are stiffening up again.
Try to keep the repeats on a level that feels good. The amount of
repeats are only a recommendation. You'll find very quickly which
amount of repeats is the best for you, but don't do less than 10
repeats.

**Remember that if you're impatient and force your body you will only strain something  and have to wait until you heal, before you can start again. The only situation where "overstretching" is allowed is when doing assisted stretches since you're to be completely relaxed and the assistant is doing the stretching for you!**

Always follow the instructions carefully and religiously and never give
up. In time you will be able to do the exercise. Not all are able to do
all the exercises at once and the difference in how long it takes for
succeeding in an exercise or position is different for everyone. It can
take days for some while other need months. Some quickly gets flexible
in their back and at the same time hits the wall when it comes to the
splits. Others manage the splits, but has difficulties with doing
backbends. Don't let that stop you. Do more exercises in the tough part
of the body instead. It will give results in the longer run. This
difference is also often noticed between men and women so don't give
up. Take your time and you'll won't hurt yourself. Everyone is able to
do this if they exercise properly and do each exercise until it feels
comfortable. Have patience.

If you have time feel free to repeat the schedule (I think you will very
soon). That is one of the keys to success. You should notice an increase
in your flexibility and strength towards the end of your exercise
period.

After doing the stretching exercises it can be good to do the stretches,
but only with one repeat, the same way as you did in the warm up. This
way you can convince yourself and, most important, your mind what your
real flexibility is and this will help you the next time when you
stretch out. Those five minutes doing this are as important as the whole
exercise. What the brain believes and what's really happening are two
different things.

Also it's good to have someone watching you while you exercise, not
only to make certain you carry them out correctly, but to ensure your
backbends are carried out by the whole spine and not just between two
vertebrae. Particular care should be taken in the area of the lower
back. Finally when you do backbend exercises **always** do frontbend
exercises afterwards. If you can't have someone watching you while you
exercise see if you can record it on video. That way you can check your
progress as well as correct any errors, but show us if necessary. 

## Assisted stretching

If you have difficulty getting into the position or to keep the stretch
you <span class="underline">always should</span> have someone to [assist you](./assparex). It's the best way to get the best
results and most athletes, dancers, gymnasts and other professionals
have their coaches to assist them in their stretching. One of the
assistants most important functions is to keep you in the position,
since otherwise you'll most likely go out of the position or stretch
far to early. The assistant should push you firmly and if you're
advanced very firmly into the position and then hold you in it for at
least 30 seconds, then release so that there's no stretch for a short
time, again repeating giving it a little bit more stretch than the last
time as many times as mentioned in the exercise schedule or more until
the muscles can't be stretched more. For each repeat the time the
assistant holds you should increase with a few seconds seconds. **You
must stay completely relaxed at all times.** The second most important
function of the assistant is to see that you don't get out of the
position. In the beginning this method can be quite uncomfortable and
even very painful depending on your pain treshold, but no pain gain. The
secret is not to give up and you'll soon find that you prefer to be
assisted than stretching by yourself. Assisted stretches always give far
better results than if you try to do it yourself, but this is of course
your and the coaches prerogative to choose which method to use. As force
is included the trust towards the assistant is of greatest importance.

The pictures above are of a contortion student being stretched into a
270 degree oversplit. All repeats were carried out (with a resting
around 10 degrees less from the last repeats) on both legs from sitting
in a regular split to the 270 degrees oversplit. As you can see her
first attempts weren't comfortable as you can see, but today she can
sit comfortably in a oversplit for longer periods having the rear leg
horizontally on the floor and the front leg vertically on the wall and
then change doing the same with the other legs **without standing up!** 
It took her two months doing this daily to achieve this position and six
more to be able to sit in the position for as much as one hour
comfortably.

An other example is this rhythmic gymnast. Her oversplits are amazing,
up to 300 degrees, and she can apparently, according to her coach, stay
in them without any time limits at all. The secret is that she has been
assisted in her stretches on a daily basis from the very first
beginning, when she started doing gymnastics.

An other example is Helena. She only uses assisted stretches and you can
judge from the result yourself. The picture to the right is her backbend
which she reached after over one year. Normally it takes at least the
double amount of time to accomplish a backfold like this no matter what
age you are and then you normally won't get that good without being
assisted. 

As I mentioned before assisted stretches are very uncomfortable in the
beginning, but your pain treshold and especially your endurance will
improve much faster than you think and this makes it much easier than
you think from seeing the picture above. The assistant is helping you
with what you normally wouldn't stand - holding you in a position you
wouldn't stand, because of lack of endurance or of too much initial
pain or discomfort. This, however, changes very rapidly to helping you
reaching a certain position that you wouldn't be able to reach without
any help even if you're comfortable doing it. The explanation is
simple. For most the initial reaching of a certain level of flexibility
assisted is most uncomfortable or even unbearable the first two weeks to
the first two months depending on how far you go and depending on how
flexible you are in the beginning, but it gets less and less
uncomfortable the longer time you practice and after that amount of time
you should feel comfortable in the position and instead work on staying
as longer and longer in the position and getting deeper and deeper into
it and still feeling comfortable. That's also the reason why most
professionals like acrobats, dancers, contortionists and gymnasts prefer
assisted stretches. You always should have a 20% flexibility reserve
when you're to perform in order to always being comfortable while
working. Every professional knows this. Also assisted stretching is the
most efficient way to extreme flexibility and it goes much faster than
any other mean of stretching (professionals know that too) and most
important - you can stay relaxed during all of the stretch and then it
also gets comfortable! Also your pain treshold will change the more you
do assisted stretches making it possible for you to advance much more
and faster than in the beginning. If you train together with a partner
of a different gender, and you wish to be at the same lever at all times
do assisted stretches. If it's a male partner assisted should be used.
In this case hold the stretches longer and to the same level as the
female partner.

Persons with hypermobility, hence with natural flexibility, should do
assisted stretches as much as possible. This decreases the symptoms of
hypermobility. If assisted stretches are done as described they are a
very good and effective alternative for achieving supplenes much faster.
Every exercise can be done assisted and in most you'll find notes
suggesting how this can be done, but don't be afraid to experiment.
It's not dangerous if you and your assistant know your limits and you
trust eachother. Also feel free to ask us.

You will get there sooner than you think.

<span class="important">Important notice 1!</span> Always do a frontbend after doing a backbend, even
if only once. The more advanced backbend is the more advanced frontbend
should be. They should correspond to eachother. This is for balance in
the back, but also strenghtens and lengthens the spine and the muscles
around it. It's also important to do all the other types of exercises.
They all correspond to eachother and will help you to get better
allover. 


<span class="important">Important notice 2!</span> If you have suffered from one or many dislocations
in either hips or shoulders you should learn to do controlled
dislocations as well as use assisted stretching as you mainly used
method when doing the exercises here. This often is a symptom of
hypermobility and you will sooner or later dislocate again. This is
often missed by MD's unless this is mentioned. One reason could be that
around 40% of the population are hypermobile and often without knowing
it. The symptoms can often be  pain in joints, hypermobility and
dislocations of the joints (for example if you can learn how to do a
split in a short time, partially dislocate your shoulders - that often
means that you will hear a popping or cracking sound - or if you have
overbent elbows you most likely are hypermobile). Very often the
symptoms show gradually, often with pain or dislocations, and sometimes
increase with time to states that aren't controllable. It's not a
question if it happens, but when. To prevent this it's important to
learn to do controlled dislocations, build up strenght and flexibility
around all joints and practicing contortion does all this. The reason is
simple. If a symptom like a dislocation occurs and it isn't controlled
your muscles will go into spasm. Being able to do a controlled
dislocation prevents this and it should be done many times on a daily
basis. A controlled dislocation is a dislocation where you are able to
dislocate the joint, move the limb <span class="underline">with the help of another limb or with help from someone that assists you</span> and then putting it
back to it's normal state. All joints that can be dislocated should be
trained in this order of fashion and the controlled dislocation must
become a part of your normal range of movement! It's important to train
all joints that dislocate, because that you once had an uncontrolled
dislocation in i.e. the hips doesn't mean that the next won't be in
the shoulders etc and the dislocations gradually worsens for each time
making it impossible to control them in the end. You should work the
same way with backbends and later  backfolds since the dislocations can
spread to other areas than the joints around the limbs. When working on
backbends and especially backfolds put a stick, a finger or something
appropriate to increase the fold and partially dislocate the vertebrae.
The last part is <span class="underline">very</span> important! Using [the contortion barre](./contortion_barre) is recommended. Persons that have
experienced or experiences symptoms like dislocating, pain in joint and
hypermobility should work towards being able to do all of the program to
perfection, as a prevention, to be able to get the joints and the
muscles around the joints supple to the outer limit and learn to control
them in situations like this by doing controlled dislocations as much as
possible. Also all exercises, if possible, should be done assisted with
firm stretches until the maximum suppleness is reached at least once
each day, preferrably more! This might be difficult, uncomforable and
even painful, but *only* in the beginning. It's not as difficult as it
sounds and that is something you've probably found out by now or will.
Do this with an open mind and enjoy yourself.

## Schedule construction

**Here are two examples of the order you can do the exercises in. It's
only a recommendation, since it normally is individual depending on your
flexibility and strenght, but this order has also shown to give the best
results and I suggest to do them in this order slowly advancing from the
new-beginner shedule to the advanced schedule, by doing the next more
advanced exercise. You should always strive for doing the most advanced
exercise or variation that you can.**

### Newbeginners schedule

1. [Frontbend exercise](./frontbends)
1. [Frontbend exercise](./frontbends)

If you can or have time try to do more exercises in the same order. If
possible always have someone to assist you in the stretches. If you can
make as many exercises using [the contortion barre](./contortion_barre) as possible.

## Advanced level schedule

All advanced exercises should be done with perfection without anyone
assisting you! In the last exercise have someone to assist you to get
"beyond" the position and to increase the amount of time you can stay
in the position. The same using [the contortion barre](./contortion_barre).
