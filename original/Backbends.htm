<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Backbends</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Even if you've already read about backs and backbending I would like to say some important things (and reminders)
if you're going to begin with backbending. </P>
<P>First of all when you're going to start bending your back backwards you will feel tension. Much more tension than you've ever felt before in your back. It might even feel like if it's going to
break. Don't worry, it
won't! It can also be painful in the beginning, but again that's only in the beginning of every exercise and it will disappear after a week or two. Just continue doing the exercises and don't be terrified. Your back isn't used to bend backwards this way, but as you can see it's much stronger than you think.&nbsp;</P>
<P><img border="0" src="weightb1.jpg" width="150" height="231"><img border="0" src="weightb2.jpg" width="152" height="231"><img border="0" src="weightb3.jpg" width="254" height="231"><img border="0" src="b-handstandpress.jpg" width="154" height="231"></P>
<P> This is something some people doing these exercises might feel and have felt at every stage they've continued. This applies especially to those that do assisted stretches.
When doing assisted backstretches there's a difference to other assisted
stretches. The assistant should push you firmly into the position, hold for 15
seconds, let go a bit, pull in a bit further, hold for 30 seconds and continue to
do like this until all repeats are done. In the last repeat the assistant should
hold you for as long as you can stand. What is important is that when holding you can
and should move, maybe twist if possible, since this will increase the stretch, but also
loosen up your vertebrae. This will be difficult in the beginning, but you'll
both see and feel the results and soon this will be a quite comfortable way of
exercising.</P>
<P><img border="0" src="asstb1.jpg" width="220" height="147"><img border="0" src="asstb4.jpg" width="244" height="146"></P>
<P>As you can see the assisted stretches can be done in many more different ways
than what you'll see here. If you see a possibility to vary the assisted
stretches do so. The only limit is your own imagination. Especially those that suffer from hypermobility should use assisted
backstretches much to achieve ultimate flexibility in the back, but also to get
the stretches more stable. The assistant also prevents you from stopping at an early stage and it's important that you don't do that. There's also a reason why yogis, contortionists, dancers and gymnasts do assisted stretches and even if it might look extreme when not assisted don't give up. There's a reason. It's effective and not dangerous.

you train together with a partner
</FONT> of a different</font><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
gender, and you wish to be at the same lever at all times the male partner
should be assisted.
</FONT> Then hold the stretches longer and to the same level as the female
partner. </font><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Even if it might be quite uncomfortable it's only in the beginning. Don't be scared. It's normal. Instead see the benefits. You'll be doing backbends sooner than you'll think it's possible.
This way you're prepared for it.&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Another benefit with having an assistant except for
assisting you in the stretching is that they can massage your back. <font FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="2">When
do</font></FONT><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">ing backbends and
frontbends and especially assisted ones </font><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="2">the
assistant should massage the back back and forth since this </font></FONT><font face="Arial" size="2">relieves</font><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
and
stretches the vertebrae</FONT>, but also will help you to get better</font><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="2">.</font></P>
<P>Something I also recommend strongly is the use of the contortion barre when
you can do more advanced backbends. It will make it possible for you to bend
more and improve your strenght, but also improve your balance. Feel free to use
your imagination to find
which exercises could be best done using the contortion barre. <a href="contortion_barre.htm">For
schematics of the contortion barre click here.&nbsp;</a></P>
<P>There's also another thing that probably is going thru your head and that is the thought "This is weird! It looks weird! It is weird! And anyone doing this is weird! They are hurting themselves!" Not true.
Hundreds of contortionists, thousands of dancers and gymnasts, not to mention
thousands of amateurs do this daily and they haven't felt better than since they started doing this.
Feel free to ask them if you get a chance.&nbsp;</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Trust me if I say that when you'll go into the
position above the first time ...you'll scream. Not out of pain or agony, but of enjoying being able to be in this position for the first time and feeling what
you'll feel. You will enjoy being in those positions very much and it will
become a normal position - for you. We normally just never learn to be in it. You will be there
sooner than you think :-)</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Exercise 6</B> </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>This is a great back exercise because it relies on the own weight of seat and legs to tighten the bend. You will be completely relaxed in your. The cycling action will really tighten the bend as the front leg is pulling the back tighter and when the rear leg is brought forward the inertia of the moving leg will, again, tighten the bend. Because you are on your couch/chair, it is a good relaxing exercise where you will be in a comfort zone.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
<IMG SRC="Image289.jpg" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=200></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>1. Stand with the legs close to the seat and facing away from where the chest is to be. Bend backwards to get the hands to the chair/couch/bed as in the picture above. You may need to bend the knees to do this.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
<IMG SRC="Image290.jpg" WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=200></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>2. Pivot at the arms and roll back onto the chest. This may be a little bit difficult in the beginning, but you will soon find out how to do it.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
<IMG SRC="Image291.jpg" WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=166></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>3. Then wriggle into position where the hands are at the front of the chair and the chin is also taking weight on the soft chair. Keep the legs reasonably straight and the back bent comfortably. You now have a solid base where you are on the chest, chin and arms in your soft chair/couch and this provides great stability. It is a position where you can relax because there is no balance requirement.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
<IMG SRC="Image292.jpg" WIDTH=213 HEIGHT=176></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>4. From this position allow the legs and back to bend and the feet will naturally fall to a position in front of the head and either above or below the head. Perhaps initially the position will be as above...</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
<IMG SRC="Image293.jpg" WIDTH=222 HEIGHT=158></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>...but quickly more like this.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The last two positions are rest positions. The base is steady, you are relaxed (therefore confident) and the natural weight of the seat and legs is keeping the back bent.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
<IMG SRC="Image294.jpg" WIDTH=208 HEIGHT=200><IMG SRC="Image295.jpg" WIDTH=130 HEIGHT=195></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>The next part is the bendy bit! Straighten both legs to the front then with a cycling style action bring one leg back as shown above then return it to the front with the other leg. Take the other leg back this time and return it to the front. Do this cycling action to the 1-2-3-4-5 count until you have achieved 10 cycles with each leg. Now take a 5 count rest in position (never go out of the backbend even if it might feel very tence – this will disappear very fast). 4. If you're on a couch or any other kind of furniture the "straight" leg can be bent trying to touch the floor to increase the stretch as in the picture to the right. If you are finding it pleasant then increase the repeats. Rest in any of the positions if necessary. It would be better if you could rest with your feet on something. You can see that the furniture item needs to be reasonably low to get a good rest position. Use the feet to rest the back. Repeat as many times as you are comfortable but I would say 15 minimum. The more repeats the better and you will get that back really loose.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Assisted: Let the assistant lightly push you deeper into the backbend. Be relaxed at all time. </P>

<IMG SRC="Image297.jpg" WIDTH=203 HEIGHT=118></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>2. Keeping in the chest stand position lift both legs at the same time up to near parallel with the floor. This will push your backbend tighter.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
<IMG SRC="Image298.jpg" WIDTH=213 HEIGHT=149></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>3. Now bring one leg up to and then return it to position 2. Do the same exercise with the other leg. Use the count as straight (1) bent (2) straight (3) other leg bent (4) etc. Do not do it quickly but make sure there is a good folding of the back as the legs are stopped out in the extended position. The weight of the leg being stopped and raised and at all times being totally relaxed in your back will do this. Do this 15 times for each leg. Assisted: Let the assistant lightly push you deeper into the backbend. Be relaxed at all time.</P>

Let helper 1sit on your hip and pull up your feet using your body as a lever til the feet are at the height of the hip. This will pull you down hard in a deep fold and stretch your thighs to the utmost. At the same time helper 2 has her feet on your thighs while pulling your arms towards her slightly uppwards. This will make the fold even deeper. Also try to do the fold at different vertebrae to get as many of them as possible supple.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>As you have been able to see and feel in the last exercises we have proceeded from backbends to folds, meaning that instead of bending the back you're at this level folding the vertebrae.

In this position you will feel that your back is folded and that the upper back also is bent. You will need assistance to get into this position, but when you're there at this lever you'll be able to stay in it for a longer time. When lying in a backbend on the chest and the legs straight to the front have the person that assists you slide you your arms thru the legs and get them up to about knee position as above.

</FONT><P><font face="Arial" size="2">This is an advanced serie of positions
that you should do when you're able of doing backfolds. It will be very hard on
your muscles since you both work on your soupleness, strenght and endurance. Do
all of the positions exactly as told and in everyone where possible try to
tension your muscles bouncing a little bit from time to time while you hold
yourself in the backfold. Also it's important that you increase the time in the
positions the more you do this serie reaching the longest possible hold in
everyone of them. Between the positions never go out of the backbend unless it's
necessary for the change. You are supposed to push the limit here. This might
require you doing them together with other things </font><font face="Arial" size="2">necessary
for you to do, but it doesn't mean that it will cause any problems for you. For
the most advanced a suggestion can be to fall asleep in the &quot;most advanced&quot;
position. This is a natural way for your body to get accomplished to a difficult
and before &quot;unknown&quot; position.&nbsp;</font> </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>For this option, release the hands from the knees and slide them up the front of the thighs (to give some leverage and balance) and start to come out of the head down position. Still stay in the bend but pivot at the hips and bring the head higher up towards, and above the seat. You will have rolled the back and the head will be touching the seat in a very arched bend so release the hands and using the arms as a swing assist, raise the arms overhead and to the front and bring the head and body up to vertical in a standing position where you can look left and right and comment to the audience as you bring the hands to the sides.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Option 2: Drop to the floor into a split and backbend position.</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You will have a "best" front/back legs for this display so you have to establish which that is! Grasp one leg as and move the front foot slowly forward more and more, but stay in the bent position with the rear foot turned out for better stability. As you go further down, place both hands to the floor and continue to lower into a backbend split. Use the hands/arms for balance and to give some arm support. Continue until you are in the splits with a backbend. You have now got yourself on the floor.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Again, I will remind you that you are starting this dismount from a "head between the thighs" position as above. Place the hands to the floor<B>. </B>Lower to an elbow support where the toes are just touching the floor for balance. Finally lower onto the chest holding the feet which are touching the floor for stability and you can look left and right.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>If you have chosen option 3 do the following sequence.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
<IMG SRC="Image450.jpg" WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=163><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>1. Start with a chest stand with feet held beside the head</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
<IMG SRC="Image451.jpg" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=160><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>2. Progress from the start position to the second position using the hands to bring each foot into position locked under the armpits. Then have a rest pause with hands under the chin.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
<IMG SRC="Image452.jpg" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=134><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>3. Progress using the hands to grasp the legs ready to pull them down.&nbsp;<BR>
<IMG SRC="Image453.jpg" WIDTH=209 HEIGHT=165><BR>
4. Pull the legs so that the knees touch the floor. Repeat 3-4 at least 40 times never going out of the backbend. In the last repeat try to stay in position 4 for as long as you
can! A good suggestion for making this easy is to read a book, watch TV, surf on
the internet or taking a nap.</FONT> </P<script language="Javascript">
