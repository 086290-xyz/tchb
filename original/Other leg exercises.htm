<P><img border="0" src="othlex-17.jpg" width="163" height="272"><img border="0" src="vikipointe1.jpg" width="174" height="152"></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>If you have advanced to doing the pointe
exercises <u>always</u> do this exercise in the en-pointe position with the feet turned
out. Preferably it should be done barefoot, but in the beginning you can use pointe shoes. If
you are assisted then standing by a wall is recommended. The assistant should
try to help you keep the hips square by applying pressure on your thighs towards
the floor and the wall.&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><img border="0" src="sabina01.jpg" width="241" height="272"><img border="0" src="luda1.jpg" width="194" height="272"><img border="0" src="Image501.jpg" width="236" height="152"><img border="0" src="sabina02.jpg" width="276" height="153"></FONT></P>
<P>If you need some help with the balance have something, for example a barre, a
chair to
lean on or someone to assist you. To increase the pointe push your feet to the side, but
without sliding on the floor. This way the flexibility will improve both in your hips
and your feet.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><P>Exercise 7</P>
</B><P><img border="0" src="strprep-100.jpg" width="253" height="166"><img border="0" src="strprep-101.jpg" width="238" height="166"></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>Hip flexing exercise (frog sitting). Facing the floor
stand on all four and slide down as far as you can so that you sit in a split
position with your knees bent as shown above. Now tension your muscles for 20
seconds and to the count of 1-2-3-4-5 try to slide down towards the floor till
you rest on the floor. Keep the body flat on the floor, the hips square and the
knees in line with the hips for as long as you can.</FONT></P>
<P><font size="2">Assisted 1: The assistant should firmly push you down by
applying pressure to your seat until the whole of your hips and legs are hard on
the floor.</font></P>
<P><img border="0" src="strprep-102.JPG" width="227" height="166"><img border="0" src="strprep-103.JPG" width="269" height="164"></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>When you feel comfortable you can bend
backwards as far as you can (how far depends of course on how far you've
advanced with the backbends). This will increase the hip stretch and give you a
very good back stretch. Remember to keep the hips square and the knees in line
with the hips. Repeat the exercise 20 times.</P>
<P><img border="0" src="othlex203.jpg" width="192" height="216"></P>
<P>Assisted: Have the assistant keep your hip to the floor and help you bend
backwards as much as possible and then hold for 30 seconds and repeat as many
times as necessary.&nbsp;The picture above doesn't show this exactly, but it's
an alternate variation of this assisted stretch if you can do the frog sit
properly.</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><P><img border="0" src="strprep-ass-100.jpg" width="269" height="199"></P>
<P><font size="2">Assisted variation: Lie with your seat on the thighs of the
assistant while the assistant firmly pushes your legs down, holds for 30 seconds
and continues until reaching as far as possible and then holding for 1 minute at
least. </font>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2">Because this muscles group rarely is
stretched this will be painful the first times. </font>
</FONT>
<font size="2">Repeat this assisted stretch 20 times.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">Assisted variation 2: Lie on your back as shown above with
your feet towards or under a sofa for steadiness. Now have the assistant to put
his feet on your knees and very firmly push your legs down until they are hard
on the floor.&nbsp;</font></P>
<P><img border="0" src="agnieszka05.jpg" width="217" height="136"></P>
<P><font size="2">Your assistant now should hold the position for at least 1-2
minutes. Because this muscles group rarely is stretched this will be painful the
first times. Repeat this assisted stretch 20, if possible twice a day.&nbsp;</font></P>

<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Exercise 8</P>
</B>
<P><font size="2">This position is called the Lotus. Doing the lotus will
improve your hip flexibility and help you with all the other leg exercises that
include hip flexibility. You can sit in the lotus while doing any activity that
requires sitting and on any kind of foundation like the floor, your chair, bed
or couch. What is important is that you should do it as much as possible. The
more you sit in the lotus position the easier and comfortable it becomes. You
will very soon find that the lotus is a very comfortable position and then <u>you should everyday sit in the lotus for at least
for an hour per day, but preferably more without stopping and then change legs</u>.&nbsp;</font></P>
<P><img border="0" src="lotus01.jpg" width="127" height="159"><img border="0" src="lotus02.jpg" width="138" height="159"><img border="0" src="lotus03.jpg" width="179" height="159"></P>
<P><font size="2">Sit in a regular cross-legged sitting position, take hold of
your left foot with both hands and place it on your right thigh. The foot will
turn slightly so that the sole is facing upwards</font></P>
<P><img border="0" src="lotusjaqueline1.jpg" width="175" height="218"><img border="0" src="lotusviki1.jpg" width="141" height="218"></P>
<p><font size="2">Now take hold of the right foot and bring it up onto the left
thigh. This might be difficult so in the beginning you might only be able to put
the first foot on your thigh, but don't give up. Remember to have the knees to
the floor at all time. You will be able to do the
lotus sooner than you think.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="othlex-01.jpg" width="180" height="248"></p>
<p><font size="2">When you're able to sit in the lotus before doing the lotus
variations below do as shown above. Cross your arms behind your back, reach your
feet and grab them and pull the lotus as tight as possible for as long as
possible. Do this as often as you can combined with the pointe exercises, since
you also will
need to stretch your feet to beyond the pointe.&nbsp;I also recommended to do
the lotus wearing pointe shoes. The form of the shoes will make it easier for
you to stay in the lotus and especially when you do different variations like
the below.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="1">Practicing the lotus in combination with pointe exercises as
in exercise 7 will also help you to avoid getting arthritis in your legs.</font></p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="lotusviki3.jpg" width="234" height="140"><img border="0" src="lotusviki4.jpg" width="232" height="141"><img border="0" src="adlotus2.jpg" width="283" height="141"><img border="0" src="adlotus1.jpg" width="204" height="162"><img border="0" src="adlotus3.jpg" width="142" height="161"><img border="0" src="bb-lotus-01.jpg" width="121" height="161"><img border="0" src="adlotus6.jpg" width="216" height="162"><img border="0" src="adlotus5.jpg" width="116" height="162"><img border="0" src="backlotus.jpg" width="317" height="156"><img border="0" src="lotusbehindback.jpg" width="154" height="162"></p>
<p><font size="2">When you're able to sit in the lotus for a while you should do
different variations of the lotus like the ones shown in the examples above as
well. When doing variations of the lotus having your legs locked in the lotus will increase the stretches
of the hip joints and in some cases the back dramatically.&nbsp;The last one is
a more difficult one. It will require you to dislocate your hips, but at that
level this shouldn't be a problem. Doing the legs behind the head exercises and
the lotus will help you to get there safely.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="othlex-11-kandasana.jpg" width="219" height="167"><img border="0" src="pierre1.jpg" width="191" height="167"><img border="0" src="pierre2.jpg" width="177" height="167"><img border="0" src="pierre3.jpg" width="165" height="167"></p>
<p><font size="2">You can also use the lotus with all it's variations to improve
advanced yoga asanas like the kandasana. This is a natural step when being able
to sit in the lotus comfortably and the lotus with all it's variations is a
good starting point together with all the oversplit exercises and especially
dislocations. From the lotus it's especially easy to dislocate the leg that is
lying on the thigh just by putting one hand on the thigh, grabbing the foot with
the other hand and pulling it up very slowly, but firmly until the leg is pointing up in a vertical
position. This is the easiest way to achieve kandasana and should be repeated at
least 20 times or as many times as necessary with each leg till it's easy to do and preferably with assistance.
<u> The assistant should firmly pull the legs upwards and never stop until the leg is pointing up in a vertical
position or beyond.</u> Also don't be afraid to
experiment. Your hip joints can take much more than you think. They are the
strongest joints in the body.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="othlex-07.JPG" width="148" height="137"><img border="0" src="othlex-09.jpg" width="159" height="135"><img border="0" src="othlex-10.jpg" width="113" height="136"><img border="0" src="othlex-14.JPG" width="180" height="136"></p>
<p><font size="2">Variations of pulling the leg up as mentioned above is shown
above. All are however results of doing the lotus and pulling the leg up to a
dislocated position in the end. The secret is not to stop... or have someone to
assist you all the way till the hip is fully dislocated and the leg is fully
pointing vertically.&nbsp;</font></p>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Exercise 9</P>
</B></FONT><P><IMG SRC="othspl1.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=210></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>This position is called a vertical leg raise. It is advisable to do splits exercise 2 before. Sit on the floor in a comfortably balanced position. Raise one leg and hold the foot/ankle with the opposite hand and straighten it to vertical behind the shoulder of the raised leg. Hold for a 5 count then change legs. Repeat until you have done this 15 times with each leg. </P>
<P>Assisted: Have the assistant to raise the leg, straighten it and pull it behind your back towards the opposite shoulder. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>Many exercises demand that you grab your feet or toes and many times this will cause pain and discomfort
if you don't stretch your feet and train pointe and the turnout. To avoid this you should always stretch your feet and toes pushing the leg to the front in the positions shown

at least 40-50 degrees beyond the (ballet) en-pointe position and in the starting

several degrees more than what's shown on the picture. You might hear clicking
and popping sounds, but don't worry. It's normal, because the foot consists of
many bones. Do at least 30 repeats with each foot and in the last repeat hold
for at least 1 minute with full pressure on the foot.&nbsp;This stretch can and
should be done in any of the positions shown above.&nbsp;</P>

<P>Many ballet dancers, both men and women, wear aids like adjustable footbenders while relaxing or sleeping on a daily basis. Adjusting to them can take some time, but they are often recommended. However such equipment can't be bought in normal stores and must be
ordered to be made by a craftsman.&nbsp;</P>
<P><img border="0" src="boot1.jpg" width="217" height="325"></P>
<P>If you can't have footbenders made another very recommended method is wearing
<a href="balletboots.htm">ballet boots</a>. Read about this <a href="balletboots.htm">here</a>.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>Walking around in en-pointe is
probably something you imagine will be the &quot;worst&quot; part, at least in the beginning, but you'll learn to like it sooner than you
think, because you'll learn both to endure much more and your pain treshold will
become much better. I recommend to walk around and stand only in en-pointe position as shown above for at least 10
minutes in the beginning and then increase the amount of time the more you
progress. Initially you will need to hold on to something. What is important is that you do this <u>daily</u>. Many ballet dancers walk in
en-pointe bare foot for at
least 30-45 minutes and then 2 hours with pointe shoes (around 30 minutes at
the barre for warming up and then 120 minutes dancing). You'll also be able to do
that in time. Pointe training will
strenghten and stretch the calfs and get the feet and toes used to this
position. The stretches mentioned above will also be improved a lot. In the beginning you'll probably need assistance or will need to hold on to
something, a barre is a good suggestion, because this requires both strenght and
a special walking technique very similar to the
one seen in ballet and only training will get you there. Therefor you should always begin in the turnout,
because this walking technique requires this! In time you'll even be able to comfortably jump
en-pointe.
Also stand in en-pointe as often as possible, for example when cooking or cleaning,
doing exercises that can be made standing or other
activities where you need to stand and roll your ankles as often as possible
while watching TV and other times.&nbsp; Learning to stand en-pointe must be done bare foot.&nbsp;

 </P><P> Only wear
pointe shoes </FONT><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="1">*)</font><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>
if it's necessary and only
in the beginning of your training. If you're going to stand en-pointe for longer
than 45 minutes in one row wear pointe shoes after the 45 minutes has passed.
One example is if you do all the exercises, where possible, en-pointe (which is
warmly recommended).&nbsp; If you use pointe shoes always stand en-pointe no matter whether
you train pointe or do any of the other exercises that require standing. If you wear pointe
shoes decrease the amount of wearing them the more you practice, but remember
the time limit mentioned above. After some time
you aren't supposed to use pointe shoes at all if you're to stand en-pointe
below 45 minutes in a row.</FONT>
 </P><P><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Also important to think of when
training pointe is not to be too overweight. The toes must be able to hold your
entire body weight, which is normally distributed to your whole foot. Therefor
your diet in combination with your training is of importance from the day you
start working on your pointe, because this will make things much easier for you
the further you advance.</font>
 </P><P><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">One situation that often occurs is
that men, because of different reasons, often are negative to pointe training
and especially in pointe training in pointe shoes. This however is a must and no
matter what gender the person is it's fully accepted as the training gets more
and more advanced, because of the necessity of pointe and turnout. This is also
normal in ballet and often both men and women are required men to dance en-pointe during the whole act. In yoga contortion sport it's the same. Being able
to stand en-pointe is necessary, since it both eases many exercises and improves the stretches.</font>
 </P><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="1">*) If you're to wear pointe shoes
make sure that they fit properly. The toes shouldn't overlap. Always
put lamb wool in the front of the shoes. Bandaids on your toes, sterile gauze cut
up an wrapped around the toes, karge gauze pads and silicon pads also are good. This is not
only for your own comfort, but for
the shoe to last longer. When putting it on always have the toes bent as much as
possible so that
you feel pressure against the upper side of the toes. <a href="Balletshoe2.jpg"> Then tie the laces very
tightly in pointe position.</a> This way you won't damage the shoes. </font></p>

 </P><P><font face="Arial" size="2">After practicing pointe always stretch your
heels by doing the stretch above, preferably assisted. From standing on the
floor bend your knees as much as you can towards a sitting position without
lifting any part of the soles off the floor and hold for 30 seconds. Do 30
repeats or as many as necessary to be able to sit on your heels without lifting
the soles of the floor. If you're assisted have the assistant push you down as
shown above and hold you there as long as necessary.</font>
