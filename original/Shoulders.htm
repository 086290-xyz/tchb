<P ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In this section you will limber up
you shoulders and with time have full movement range and be able to do shoulder
dislocations.<b> If you have had any shoulder dislocations, can do them or are
close to be able to do them please read the introduction to shoulder
dislocations and the important notice below very carefully.</b></font></P>
<P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><P>Exercise 1</FONT> </B> </P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image456.jpg" WIDTH=165 HEIGHT=200><IMG SRC="Image338.jpg" WIDTH=105 HEIGHT=197></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>This exercise is the same as in the warmup. The difference is that in the stretching exercise you're supposed to grasp the hand/arm higher and higher until you can hold your wrist or even above it. This will give a good stretch and also give you very supple shoulders. Now put your left arm down your back as far as you can. Bring right arm up your back from below. Using a 1-2-3-4-5 count, push left down and right up. Change arms and repeat. Do 20 repeats with each arm at the top.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>Assisted: Have the assistant to pull your upper arm down and the lower
up, if possible til there's a dislocation. If the shoulder dislocates the
assistant should hold the position for at least 30 seconds and continue the stretch as
far as possible in each repeat.</FONT> </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><P>Exercise 2</B></FONT> </P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image339.jpg" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=192></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>This exercise is very easy, but will take time to learn to do. Sit on the floor with your holding the hands behind the back as in the picture above.</FONT> <BR>
<IMG SRC="Image340.jpg" WIDTH=210 HEIGHT=156><IMG SRC="Image341.jpg" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=156></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>Now lean backwards keeping your arms straight. Hold your thumbs for support and slide down the floor as far as you can. Repeat this exercise
<u>at least</u> 10 times and don't worry about dislocations. This exercise improves your range of movement, but only dislocates the joints
partially. </P>
<P><img border="0" src="Jaqueline4.jpg" width="270" height="180"> </P>
<P>This is Jaqueline in the last repeat of this exercise. As you can see the
most important thing is to stay relaxed.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>Assisted: Have your assistant to help you keep the arms straight,
keep your hands together and stretch, if possible til there's a dislocation. If
the shoulder dislocates the assistant should hold the position for at least 30 seconds
and continue the stretch as far as possible in each repeat. </P>
</FONT><P><img border="0" src="oth-ass-02.jpg" width="161" height="134"><img border="0" src="oth-ass-01.jpg" width="259" height="134"></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>Another way is kneeling as above and let the assistant stretch your
shoulders as shown above. Don't stop until your hands touch the floor. They will
be do after some time. If the exercise is done assisted repeat it 30 times holding for 20 30 seconds and stay in the position for 2 minutes when doing the last
repeat.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>If you prefer it you can also lie on your stomach and let the assistant stretch your arms the same way as in the exercise.
Also here you shouldn'y stop until your hands or if possible the whole of the
arms touch the floor. If the exercise is done assisted repeat it 30 times holding for 20 30 seconds and stay in the position for 2 minutes when doing the last
repeat.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=1><P>You probably expect that you will feel the partial dislocation (or sometimes even a full dislocation), but the fact is that in time with this range of movement this will feel like any normal move. It's all about
believing. </P>

<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>When you're going to limber up your
shoulders you'll come to the point either when they will be partually dislocated
or fully dislocated. Ever wanted to learn how to do shoulder dislocations? Then
read this first. You have probably already done partial dislocations when you've
done exercise 1 and 2 and found out that this is nor difficult, dangerous or
unpleasant to do.&nbsp; </P>
<P> Shoulder dislocations has been used as a party trick and act for ages now. Something that is a fact as you probably know from doing the shoulder exercise 1 is that the shoulders get very supple and feel much more
loose. This helps you if you want to dislocate the shoulders. <B>Dislocating the shoulders isn't dangerous at all, but it has to be controlled.</B> The feeling when the shoulders are dislocating is that you feel and hear popping
and clicking sounds as the arms slide out of the shoulder sockets, then slide back into them
again. Of course you have to limber up your shoulders to do this, you cannot do it right off or you would injure
yourself.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>Anyone that has done controlled shoulder dislocations enjoys it every time, but there are some things important to know and that's also why I want you to look at the pictures above. Doing a dislocation is really about two things: believing that it's possible to do easily and doing it right. The pictures and what I will tell you helps you with the first part and later on with the second part.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>The dislocations above are controlled, there is a vast difference between a dislocated joint that has fully come out of the socket and a joint that has moved from the normal position. So long as the joint stays within the normal socket range of movement it can be controlled and will carry weight and have strength. If the joint comes right out of the socket then it no longer has any pivot point and the muscles can not control the limb movement If out of the socket the limb <B>has</B> to he held or it will get into an uncontrolled position and the brain will make the muscles go into spasm. Therefor dislocations are much about believing or even better knowing it's possible and holding the limb. Also the muscles has to be stretched out to the maximum. Knowing that you will be able to very calmly dislocate your shoulders one at a time and hold the arm with the other hand. It is the same with the hip sockets. If you have done all the exercises you have already done a partial dislocation in the frontbends exercise 1 position 1 in the variation and you probably didn't knew about it.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>Before doing dislocations there are different ways to limber up. Except for the exercises here a good and easy way to limber up your shoulders, which is possible to do everywhere, is to get something like a piece of rope (or towel), hold on to it in front of you with your hands about 70-90 cms apart and then, without letting the rope slide in your hands and while keeping your arms straight, rotate your arms up and back until both your hands are pointing at the floor behind you, then rotate it up and over your head until your arms are in front of you again. As you progress keep bringing your hands closer together until you can do it without using the rope or towel. As you progress your shoulders will dislocate, but it's a controlled dislocation.</FONT> </P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image457.jpg" WIDTH=211 HEIGHT=176></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>Also do the stretch shown in the picture above using a 1-2-3-4-5 count for 15
repeats.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>When you're limbered up this is an easy way to do a controlled dislocation. There are a few steps and the important thing is to hold the arm with the other hand all the time you're doing it.It will take some time before you get a grip of it, so don't get dissapointed if you don't have any success the first
times. If you're afraid have someone to assist you the first 25 times.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>1. Lift your arm so that it's pointing up vertical.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>2. If the arm is the right arm rotate it clockwise
preferably 360 degrees while helping with the other hand to get it out of the socket pushing it upwards to the front. Don't use any
force, more than you feel necessary! The important is that you can control the
joint with the other hand.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>3. Your arm should be now be dislocated (thanks
to the twisting) and you should always hold it with the other hand whatever you do. One thing you can do is to lay it on your shoulders. This is something that is very enjoyable to do.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>Now when you have your shoulder dislocated just do things above reversed and it''l fall back in to it's
socket. Again remember to stay relaxed and do not tense up if you loose control over the limb for a moment – simply try to return the joint to natural state and everything will be as normal.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>During any dislocation have the muscles around the joint relaxed.</FONT> </P>
<P><IMG SRC="should1.jpg" WIDTH=208 HEIGHT=155><IMG SRC="should2.jpg" WIDTH=249 HEIGHT=154></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>Another way of controlling the dislocated
joint is to hold your elbows with your hands as above. This makes it easy for you to move the arms back and forth dislocating each time you move the arms to either left or
right. Remember that you should relax the limb that is moved out of it’s
socked. One of the shoulders might be less flexible than the other. Do as with all other
stretches. Do the double amount of repeats on it.&nbsp; </P>
<P><img border="0" src="Jaqueline5.jpg" width="183" height="210"><img border="0" src="Jaqueline6.jpg" width="253" height="210"><img border="0" src="Jaqueline7.jpg" width="249" height="210"> </P>
<P>Again here is Jaqueline demonstrating her dislocation. She uses a very
similar technique to the shown above, but then it changes. She starts off with
holding her elbow with her hand and pulling it until the arm dislocates (which
easily can be seen here). Then she straightens the elbow making it possible for
her hand to slide towards the hand of the dislocated limb and making it possible
to grip the hand and pull downwards making the dislocation complete. In the
process the arm has rotated a few degrees increasing the dislocation even more.
As you can see the dislocations of the shoulders can be made in many different
ways and I've shown the most usual. The most important however is to stay
relaxed. </P>
<P>You will need to force or strain the shoulder joints in the process and feel
a bit discomfort, but sometimes that is necessary in the beginning and you
shouldn't be worried, because in time you'll be able to dislocate the shoulder
joints with ease. Therefor assisted stretches are recommended in the beginning until your joint comes
out of it's socket with ease, but also to prevent you from stopping at an early
point. If you're hypermobile continue with the assisted stretches beyond that.
Also i<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">f you train together with a partner </font>of
a different<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> gender, and you wish to be at the same
lever at all times the male partner should be assisted. </font>Then hold the
stretches longer and to the same level as the female partner (in this case till
the dislocation occurs). </P>
<P></FONT> </P>
<font FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><b>
<p>Important notice!<font FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="2"> </font></b><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="2">If
you have suffered from one or many dislocations in either hips or shoulders you
should learn to do controlled dislocations. This often is a symptom of
hypermobility and you will sooner or later dislocate again. A medical term for
this is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, but often this disease is missed by most MD’s
unless it’s mentioned. Around 40% of the population has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
and often without knowing it. The symptoms are often pain in joints,
hypermobility and dislocations of the joints (for example if you can learn how
to do a split in a short time, partially dislocate your shoulders - that often
means that you will hear a popping or cracking sound - or if you have overbent
elbows you most likely have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome). Very often the symptoms
show gradually, often with pain or dislocations, and increase with time to
states that aren't controllable. It's not a question if it happens, but when. To
prevent this it’s important to learn to do controlled dislocations, build up
strenght and flexibility around all joints and practicing yoga and contortion
does all this. The reason is simple. If a symptom like a dislocation occurs and
it isn’t controlled your muscles will go into spasm. Being able to do a
controlled dislocation prevents this and it should be done many times on a daily
basis. A controlled dislocation is a dislocation where you are able to dislocate
the joint, move the limb <u>with the help of another limb or with help from
someone that assists you</u> and then putting it back to it's normal state. All
joints that can be dislocated must be trained in this order of fashion and the
controlled dislocation must become a part of your normal range of movement! It's
important to train all joints that dislocate, because that you once had an
uncontrolled dislocation in i.e. the hips doesn't mean that the next won't be in
the shoulders etc and the dislocations gradually worsens for each time making it
impossible to control them in the end. You should work the same way with
backbends and later&nbsp; backfolds since the dislocations tend to spread to
other areas than the joints around the limbs. When working on backbends and
especially backfolds put a stick, a finger or something appropriate to increase
the fold and partially dislocate the vertebrae. The last part is <u>very</u>
important! Using <a href="contortion_barre.htm">the contortion barre</a> is
recommended. Persons that have experienced or experiences symptoms like
dislocating, pain in joint and hypermobility should work towards being able to
do all of the program to perfection, as a prevention, to be able to get the
joints and the muscles around the joints supple to the outer limit and learn to
control them in situations like this by doing controlled dislocations as much as
possible. Also all exercises, if possible, should be done assisted with firm
stretches until the maximum suppleness is reached at least once each day,
preferrably more! This might be difficult, uncomforable and even painful, but
only in the beginning. It’s not as difficult as it sounds and that is
something you’ve probably found out by now or will.</font></p>
