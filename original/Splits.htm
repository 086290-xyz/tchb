<P>Important notice!<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2> If you have suffered from one or many dislocations in either hips or shoulders you should learn to do controlled
dislocations. This often is a symptom of hypermobility and you will sooner or later dislocate
again. A medical term for this is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, but often this disease is missed by most MD’s unless it’s
mentioned. Around 40% of the population has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and often
without knowing it. The symptoms are often pain in joints, hypermobility and dislocations of the
joints (for example if you can learn how to do a split in a short time,
partially dislocate your shoulders - that often means that you will hear a
popping or cracking sound - or if you have overbent elbows you most likely have Ehlers-Danlos
Syndrome). Very often the symptoms show gradually, often with pain or
dislocations, and increase with
time to states that aren't controllable. It's not a question if it happens, but
when. To prevent this it’s important to learn to do controlled dislocations, build up strenght and flexibility around all joints and practicing yoga and contortion does all this. The reason is simple. If a symptom like a dislocation occurs and it isn’t controlled your muscles will go into spasm. Being able to do a controlled dislocation prevents
this and it should be done many times on a daily basis. A controlled dislocation
is a dislocation where you are able to dislocate the joint, move the limb <u>with
the help of another limb or with help from someone that assists you</u> and then
putting it back to it's normal state. All joints that can be dislocated must be
trained in this order of fashion and the controlled dislocation must become a
part of your normal range of movement! It's important to train all joints that
dislocate, because that you once had an uncontrolled dislocation in i.e. the hips doesn't mean that the next won't be in the shoulders
etc and the dislocations gradually worsens for each time making it impossible to
control them in the end.
You should work the same way with backbends and later&nbsp; backfolds since the dislocations tend to spread to other areas than the joints around the
limbs.
When working on backbends and especially backfolds put a stick, a finger or
something appropriate to increase the fold and partially dislocate the vertebrae.
The last part is <u>very</u>  important! Using <a href="contortion_barre.htm">the
contortion barre</a> is recommended. Persons that have experienced or experiences symptoms like
dislocating, pain in joint and hypermobility should work towards being able to do
all of the program to perfection, as a prevention, to be able to get the joints and the muscles around the joints supple to the outer limit and learn to control them in situations like
this by doing controlled dislocations as much as possible.
Also all exercises, if possible, should be done assisted with firm stretches
until the maximum suppleness is reached at least once each day, preferrably more! This might be
difficult, uncomforable and even painful, but only in the beginning. It’s not as difficult as it sounds and that is something you’ve probably found out by now or
will.</FONT> </P>

<P><IMG SRC="Image459.jpg" WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=127></P>
<STRONG><P><font face="Arial" size="2">Splits prepairing.</font></STRONG>  <font face="Arial" size="2">
For this exercise, since you’re starting to do the splits and will need to have a good steady foundation you should take the weight on the hands and lean forward so the hands are on the floor about level with the front leg knee. The rear leg should have the foot turned out so that the side of the foot is taking the weight. (Better balance!) You should drop down to a comfortable position and then to a 1-2-3-4-5 count, bounce towards sitting on the floor and the hands still take a lot of the weight. Change legs (other to the front) and do the 1-2-3-4-5 bounce. Repeat the exercise until you have done
15 left leg front and 15 right leg front.</font> </P>
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">When you are as low as you can get into your splits, tension your leg muscles tightly, like you would if you were trying to stand up from the splits, hold the tension for 30 seconds and then relax the muscles completely. When you relax you should find that you are sliding down a bit further.
Always do at least 15 repeats each leg of this for each time you are practicing your splits. Be patient! When you're able to sit in the splits do that it as often as you can. Practice 2-3 times every day. When watching TV, do the splits during the commercials. That makes great 5 minute splits. If you like to continue after the commercials too. In the end you'll find that you can sit in the splits as long as you
wish. If you like to you can apply this method as far as you advance since it
will help you to stay longer in all split positions.</font> </P>

</FONT> Another good way getting into the straddle is to put ankle weights
around the legs and do a straddle up against a wall. Gravity will naturally pull
your legs down slowly and this method is less painful. It should be done twice
daily as long as you feel difficulties getting into the straddle and it takes
some time, 30 minutes are recommended. When your legs has reached the floor you
should always hold the straddle for at least 1-5 minutes or longer. While you're
doing this exercise you can always read this handbook.</font> </P>

<P><b>Assisted variations</b> </P>
<P>At this level of flexibility assisted stretches are recommended to do. You
might find them slightly unpleasant to in the beginning, but that disappeards
quite soon and at that stage most people think that they are pleasant and
prefere to do assisted stretches. You will find that this is a quickest and best
way to achieve maximum oversplits.&nbsp; </P>
<P>When doing assisted oversplit the assistant should stretch the leg <u>slowly
as far as possible,</u> hold the stretch at least 1 minute and then release the
stretch a bit and stretch again. An example: If the assistant stretches your
legs into a 220 degrees oversplit he should hold the position there, release the
stretch to 200 degrees, then again stretch to 230, hold, release to 210 degrees,
stretch to 240 degrees, hold, release to 220 degrees and so on til the maximum
oversplit is reached.&nbsp; </P>

<P>Exercise 16</FONT></B> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>This is a more advanced oversplit
exercise. Doing it you will be capable of partially dislocating the hip socked and it will prepare you for
something many call crazy splits, but most important to more advanced yoga
asanas where a full dislocation is necessary. For this the hip socket must almost come out of joint to get the movement
required.&nbsp;</P>

<P>For this you will need to prepare already when doing the oversplit and
overstraddle exercises. This is easily done by changing between the oversplits
and overstraddles without going out of the oversplit/overstraddle as shown above
by Gosia. You should do this for 15 times after doing both types of splits. This
will prepare you for this exercise and make it easier. You will have to to force or strain the hip joints in the process and
feel a bit discomfort, but that is necessary in the beginning and you shouldn't
be worried. Anyone can become able to hip dislocate and with dislocation they are then able to do this exercise with
ease. Doing the oversplit exercises over and over again here will help you getting there and then your dislocating hips will allow you to do this. During the exercise you must be completely relaxed in the leg and let
the leg rest while moving.</FONT> <BR>
<IMG SRC="Image269.jpg" WIDTH=251 HEIGHT=159></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>You start by doing the front split with the heel up on a chair or similar and lower into the front split sitting on the floor with the leg raised and the rear leg flat behind you. In this position the hip is on its way
out. This can feel a bit odd the first times, but stay relaxed and don’t try to move the leg.</FONT> <BR>
<IMG SRC="Image270.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=198></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>Then, keeping the raised foot vertical, and still sitting firmly on the floor, very slowly turn the body through 90 degrees so that the leg up is now to the side. The hip socket will move out a bit more to not quite complete
dislocation and you might hear <font face="Arial" size="2">popping and </font>clicking
sounds, but this is normal. The new position will be a very oversplit to the side. Repeat
at least 20 times with each leg and if possible 2 or 3 times each day (a
recommendation is in the morning, at lunch time and in the evening). If you feel you can do a deeper oversplit change chairs, couch or put something under to get the legs up higher.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>Remember that the big thing is to stay relaxed.&nbsp;
If a full dislocation occurrs do not tense up – you will still feel comfortable. Just continue the
stretch as far as possible. When you turn your body back the joint will automatically return to it’s natural
state. Preferably try to be assisted and if you like to experiment as much as you like.... Also you will most
likely hear little clicks and pops from your joint, but that is no cause for
concern. It's normal.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>Assisted: Assisted stretches are highly recommended until your joint comes out of it's socket with
ease. They are also necessary, because they also
prevent you from stopping at an early point (even if you wouldn't use assisted
stretches never stop at an early point). If you're hypermobile continue with
the assisted stretches beyond a full dislocation. Have the assistant to hold the leg while you turn the body. Then have the assistant raise the leg up
as far as possible, hold and down again and rotate the leg 90 degrees
to each side back and forth (it's possible to rotate the leg 180 degrees!) until
the stretch and dislocation feels comfortable. This might take time, but will loosen your joint even more and give a good stretch. To make the stretch even better the assistant can also slowly pull your leg backwards
and upwards 30-50 degrees while rotating the leg as mentioned
above. This time the rotation can easily be beyond 180 degrees each direction
and eases the dislocation. Another way to increase the stretch in the dislocation is to start in the
oversplit to the front, raise the front leg to a vertical position and then move
it to the side (left leg to the left side, right leg to the right side) and then
back again as many times as necessary.&nbsp;I<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">f you train together with a

<B><P>&nbsp; </P>
<P>Important notice!<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2> If you have suffered from one or many dislocations in either hips or shoulders you should learn to do controlled
dislocations. This often is a symptom of hypermobility and you will sooner or later dislocate
again. A medical term for this is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, but often this disease is missed by most MD’s unless it’s
mentioned. Around 40% of the population has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and often
without knowing it. The symptoms are often pain in joints, hypermobility and dislocations of the
joints (for example if you can learn how to do a split in a short time,
partially dislocate your shoulders - that often means that you will hear a
popping or cracking sound - or if you have overbent elbows you most likely have Ehlers-Danlos
Syndrome). Very often the symptoms show gradually, often with pain or
dislocations, and increase with
time to states that aren't controllable. It's not a question if it happens, but
when. To prevent this it’s important to learn to do controlled dislocations, build up strenght and flexibility around all joints and practicing yoga and contortion does all this. The reason is simple. If a symptom like a dislocation occurs and it isn’t controlled your muscles will go into spasm. Being able to do a controlled dislocation prevents
this and it should be done many times on a daily basis. A controlled dislocation
is a dislocation where you are able to dislocate the joint, move the limb <u>with
the help of another limb or with help from someone that assists you</u> and then
putting it back to it's normal state. All joints that can be dislocated must be
trained in this order of fashion and the controlled dislocation must become a
part of your normal range of movement! It's important to train all joints that
dislocate, because that you once had an uncontrolled dislocation in i.e. the hips doesn't mean that the next won't be in the shoulders
etc and the dislocations gradually worsens for each time making it impossible to
control them in the end.
You should work the same way with backbends and later&nbsp; backfolds since the dislocations tend to spread to other areas than the joints around the
limbs.
When working on backbends and especially backfolds put a stick, a finger or
something appropriate to increase the fold and partially dislocate the vertebrae.
The last part is <u>very</u>  important! Using <a href="contortion_barre.htm">the
contortion barre</a> is recommended. Persons that have experienced or experiences symptoms like
dislocating, pain in joint and hypermobility should work towards being able to do
all of the program to perfection, as a prevention, to be able to get the joints and the muscles around the joints supple to the outer limit and learn to control them in situations like
this by doing controlled dislocations as much as possible.
Also all exercises, if possible, should be done assisted with firm stretches
until the maximum suppleness is reached at least once each day, preferrably more! This might be
difficult, uncomforable and even painful, but only in the beginning. It’s not as difficult as it sounds and that is something you’ve probably found out by now or
will.</FONT> </P>
