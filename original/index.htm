<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Ever wondered how those incredible 
contortionists and acrobats you've seen on TV or at the circus can do their fantastic poses or how yogis can move their bodies in a way that you never thought was possible and how they feel? Ever wanted to be able to do it yourself? Here's the chance. It might take 
&quot;time, blood, sweat and tears&quot;, but you will get there with the exercises you'll find here if you just give it some time every day.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </P>
</FONT></FONT> <P><font face="Arial" size="2">The exercises used in contortion
(and yoga as well) is used by various circus artists, dancers, gymnasts and many
others. </font><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>It is a wonderful feeling to be able to move the body without any limitations and 
the goal with this page is to show you how to do it and most important: how to 
get there. Having practiced myself as well as trained others me and my 
co-authors have noticed that much of this is kept almost like a trade secret and 
believe it shouldn't be. An other reason is that there are many &quot;schools&quot;, more 
or less experimental, that also should be mentioned as they can have the effect 
that you search for, but can't find.</FONT>   There can also be the situation
where you don't have a coach or school in your area. In the process of writing and
publishing previous versions of this handbook me and my co-authors have received
numerous of mails from all parts of the world. We want to share that experience
as well as it might be of use for you in your training.&nbsp;So one of the most
important reasons that this handbook is published is simply: we don't want the
knowledge to be lost. It should be available everywhere.</FONT></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>To tell the truth
</FONT> exercising to improve your strength and flexibility the way
contortionists, dancers, gymnasts and many others do <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>isn't as difficult as it
seems</FONT> </FONT><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"> - nor is it dangerous
(as some may believe when they see it)<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>. </FONT></font><font face="Arial" size="2">A common question is if it
hurts and for example, if a dislocation of a joint hurts or has permanent side 
effects. The answer to that is simple: it doesn't hurt and there are no negative 
permanent side effects. It is uncomfortable in the beginning, but you feel the
discomfort lesser for each time you do the exercises and sometimes even each
time you repeat an exercise while you carry out the schedule. The more you exercise the more pleasant it feels. Any position you will see
feels natural and will feel the same to you if you follow the instructions and 
give it some time. Just
to give an example I can tell you how it feels to dislocate the shoulder in a
proper way when you are used to it. First you feel something like a crack or 
click and then you can feel the joint slide out of the socket. The feeling is amazing, because
everything happens inside you and it's like a tickling sensation. It doesn't hurt
for a second. Instead it feels like the bones inside were swimming around in
a mass of gelly. That is probably the best description. Does it sound terrible?
I hope it doesn't, because it isn't. Practice will give you exactly that 
feeling, a body that is able to move in any way you wish, a great portion of 
satisfaction and as a bonus you'll stay healthy. So
as you can understand this can be a<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2> natural <I>way of living</I></FONT> </font> <I><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">
and I hope it will be for you too</font></I><font face="Arial" size="2">. A <a href="backinfo.htm"> backbend (or even
backfold)</a> that might look impossible </font> <font face="Arial" size="2">or
even freaky </font><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>to you will in time feel like any natural move and be very enjoyable to do. Just observe any member of the animal
kingdom. Every animal exercises every day and they instinctively know that the secret of a long and healthy life is a flexible
spine. Any part of the body that is not continually used will eventually cease to
function. Most people don't stretch, do yoga or contort and maybe there's the 
key to why many have trouble with their spines and other health issues connected 
to bad posture and an unhealthy and poorly trained spine. Anyone, including you, can become good if you only take your time and believe that you will get there one
day, because it's much about believing and giving it time. For some it will take no time at all, but some will have to struggle a little bit, maybe because you've lost some of your flexibility because of age. Something that is recommended is to stretch daily for around a month before you start doing these
exercises. Easier yoga asanas like the sun greeting are recommend warmly since it will give you the basic flexibility and strenght needed to do the exercises without struggling too
much, but normal stretching is enough. Also it's worth mentioning that yoga is 
<u>very</u> similar to contortion. </FONT> </P>

  <P align="center"><BR>
  </FONT> <font face="Arial" size="3"><B>Who can practice?</B></font> </P>

<P align="left"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Anyone that is serious, willing to put enough time and has patience. Some say that any over the age of 25 years shouldn't start contorting. Others refuse to train men, because they 
considered as good as women (or maybe the coach doesn't like to train men due to 
other issues not needed to be mentioned here?). Let's kill those myths. There 
are men that are 55 years old and can do many of the poses and exercises on 
these pages and the only difference between a man starting in the middle age and 
for example a 20 year old woman that has started in her childhood is that it takes him longer time to be
successful with the same things she is in
short time</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </P>
<P align="left">&nbsp;</P>
</FONT></FONT><B><P align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">What types of contortionists are
there?</font> </P>
<P align="left"></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Either a contortionist is are a "frontbender" or a "backbender" and all the facets of the act are built on these movements and the ability to hyperextend or hyperflex the spine. The frontbender is many times the "funny man" as he can take up ludicrous positions and perform amusing feats like placing the feet around the neck while standing on one hand. This doesn't mean that men can't be good backbenders. There are men that can do better backbends than any woman and to know whether you're one of them the only way to find out is to do the exercises and in time see. In contrast to the frontbender the backbender or "posturer" has a more serious act. It's often a woman, but as I said it doesn't have to be like that. The backbender performs speciality acts or incorporates the abilities into a graceful dance routine.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>To get back to the question who can do this the answer is, as you can see, anyone. What makes the difference is that to be good you have to practice daily and the more the better. One day of inactivity will result in a marked stiffening of the joints. However this is something that happens in any type of activity. Practicing is the key to being good 
(and avoiding cigarettes, alcohol and other poisons).</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>So why not begin? You don't know what you've been missing.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </P>
<P align="left">&nbsp;</P>
</FONT></FONT><B><P align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">How much practice 
do I need?</font> </P>
<P></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>First of 
all let me point out that this is VERY individual and also depends on what goals 
you set. A contortionist <i>can </i>practice for around three hours daily or even more. Don't get scared of this. You decide the amount of training and who said that you want to be a contortionist? 
Even if you want to practice for three hours it can be one hour in the morning, one during the day and one in the evening before going to bed.
</FONT>As you can see a good way can be to divide up the exercising so that you do them during the
day, for example a set of exercises in the morning, while having lunch, after getting home and before going to
bed ans different exercises in the different blocks. <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> The alternative with
</FONT><font face="Arial" size="2">dividing up</font><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> the practicing will help you to keep
</FONT></FONT><font face="Arial" size="2">the maximum possible <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>supple</FONT></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">ness<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>.</FONT>You'll soon find out that you can do many of the exercises while doing something else like...&nbsp; </P>
<P align="center"><img border="0" src="Exerci1.jpg" width="227" height="138"><img border="0" src="Exerci2.gif" width="210" height="138"> </P>
<P align="center">...when watching TV, reading a book...&nbsp; </P>
<P align="center"><IMG SRC="Image408.jpg" WIDTH=199 HEIGHT=197> </P>
</font>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>
<P align="left">...or even chatting on the internet and that you'll be
comfortable and enjoy doing it at all times. As with everything the more you do
it the better and then why not combining it with other things you have to do? It
will definately make the practicing much more interesting, so don't be afraid of
having fun. If you have done all the exercises and feel that you have more time then
try to do them over again. You will be amazed over how much easier it will be. Repeats are the secret to become and stay real
supple. You also build strenght in the muscles this way. </P>
<P>But again, as I said before, your set goals also have a lot to say and it can 
be well enough with an hour daily to increase the overall flexibility, even if 
it won't make you a contortionist.<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> Most likely you'll 
end up practicing for more, because you'll enjoy it very much. However it's 
important to point out that you should do the exercises daily if you want any 
results, even if you only do that hour each day (and around one hour is what you should begin with). </FONT></FONT>
<font face="Arial" size="2">R</font><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>emember that loosing one day of exercising means that it can take up to one week to reach the same level of flexibility. The same is if you miss out a weeks exercises. It can take a month to reach the same level. So if you can't set aside some time each day to exercise don't start practicing at all (and miss the best experience of your life)!</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>No matter who you are if you only do what's told in the instructions you will be able to do most or everything shown and you'll be hooked in no time. Already after one week you will see results and be amazed. The most interesting thing you'll find out quick is that your brain won't understand what's happening. 
Never underestimate the strength of the mind! If you close your eyes and do a backbend or split or which position you want to do you'll be amazed and pleased over that you can do it so well and maybe how deep it is the second you open your eyes. That gives an extreme
rush</FONT></FONT> <font face="Arial" size="2"> and is one reason why most get addicted</font><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>. Only this feeling is something making it worth to try. 
Depending on if the exercises are carried out according to the instructions, 
your age, suppleness/stiffness and if you train daily it's estimated to take around 3-12 months 
for you to be able to place your feet on either side of your head, from a prone position, but of course the younger you are when you start, the easier it will be.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT></FONT><B><P align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">Some about food&nbsp;</font> </P>
<P align="left"></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Someone once said that eating is believing and it maybe sounds silly, but it's the truth. There are as many recommendations on what to eat as ways to train. Some say become a vegetarian, but I don't agree.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You can continue to eat meat, but not as much as before and 
avoid fat as much as possible. That means continue eating what you ate before, but in normal proportions 
and with a little bit more awareness of what you eat. Listen to your body and most important of all eat healthy. If your body asks for fruits, eat fruits and so on. You'll also soon find out that you'll quite automaticly change your habits.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Something I recommend is to eat fruits, hazelnuts and a cup of tea for breakfast. For lunch eggs and some fruits and to dinner always something cooked like meat or fish, root-crops/- fruits and some fruits. You can use all kinds of spices, but try to avoid salt as much as possible (this will be difficult in the beginning, but after some time you won't want salt to any kind of food, because it will taste awful). Except for that eat berries, sea food and honey. Also try 
<u><b>not</b></u> to eat for 1-2 hours before you exercise. Doing a backbend or a frontbend with a full stomach isn't recommended 
and can result in you throwing up. Also try not to drink alcohol and absolutely never smoke. If you start to train and drink alcohole (even if not a big amount) or smoke just one cigarette you will feel that your training will feel more difficult and you'll maybe not have the same range of movement the next day.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The result of this will be that you'll loose weight to what was your teenager average weight, the blood preasure will get lower and the same with the colesterole. You will feel much better, think much better and it's much easier to practice.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The eating habits above remind much of what different yoga books recommend and contortion
<i>is</i> very similar to yoga. The same food was also eaten by people in the 
stone age as well as today by the people on the island of Kitava where the living conditions are similar to the ones in the stone age. Many times the people there are very strong, flexible and 
your average day heart disease doesn't exist there. The difference to what I 
mentioned above, except for the alcohol, is that they also avoid sugar, milk or cheese.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>
However i</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>n the end you decide what to eat and drink and these were only some healthy thoughts and recommendations to help you on the way. One thing is important 
though: DON'T EAT MORE THAN NOW AND NOT TOO MUCH!!!! <i>The exercises will make you hungry, but that doesn't mean you need to eat more.</i></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </P>
<P align="left">&nbsp;</P>
</FONT></FONT><B><P align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">Clothing and enviroment</font> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>There are many different clothes to wear while practicing, 
but the rule (depending on where you are) is the less the better.
To wear loose fitting attire is often recommended, but unitards </FONT>or catsuits </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>are 
much better and work very well both for men and women. Most dancers, contortionists and gymnasts wear them and they give many
benefits compared to other clothes when fitted perfectly to your body.</FONT> </P>
<ul>
  <li><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> they aren't restricting, but more alike a second
    skin </FONT></FONT><font face="Arial" size="2">and that </font><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>is
  </FONT>very </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>important, because nothing then will disturb you in your
    practicing or make moves difficult or sometimes even impossible (it's
    important that the unitard is fitted perfectly to your body)</FONT></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>they keep all of you warm if they don't &quot;breathe&quot; 
	too much (latex and PVC are excellent materials for this purpose</FONT></FONT><font face="Arial" size="2">,
  something that numerous mails confirm</font><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>)</FONT>.
  The downside is that you sweat a lot, but you still stay warm and don't risk
  any injury!</FONT></li>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">they will let you slide
into the different positions (which sometimes is necessary) compared to loose
    fitting attire or bikinis. Especially if the unitard (or catsuit) is made in
    latex or PVC it will make practicing backbends, different splits and
    oversplits much easier, because there is nothing stopping you. Also working
    with the contortion barre and all other barres is made much simpler using a
    PVC catsuit.</font></FONT><font face="Arial" size="2"> If a PVC or latex
  catsuit isn't available where you live other materials can do too, but it's
  important that they are slippery and tight fitting. Before buying, if possible, 
	feel the material. The more slippery
  the better. If possible, of the same reasons, it's good if the feet are 
	covered by the catsuit. </font></li>
</ul>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>
<P align="center"><img border="0" src="latex-fb1.jpg" width="161" height="266"><img border="0" src="latex-split1.jpg" width="154" height="267"> </P>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jazz pants and a top, shorts, bikinis and similar, 
can also be good, but they need to be tight fitting and if you use such attire 
the place where you exercise MUST be well heated! Again it's important that your clothes don't disturb you in the exercises or 
restrict your movement in any way. </font></p>
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">As this handbook isn't writtein for new beginners 
only, but also for professionals, it's worth pointing out that your clothes also 
give a great impression and can lift the act to a different level while 
performing. Many times catsuits with metal or wet looks can be the excellent
choi</font></FONT><font face="Arial" size="2">c</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>e as they don't restrict the movement, but also help the audience to see 
you better if the lightning is poor or you want to use various kinds of effects.
</FONT>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>Also they are cheap.</FONT>
 In a circus tent or out in the open it can be worth not to forget that you need
to be warm. It's better to be warm and sweat than freeze and risk injury due to
that the well-effects of the warm up wear off.</font></P><P><font face="Arial" size="2">When it comes to footwear you should also invest in pointe
shoes or other shoes as pointing your feet as many
exercises are more effective when done en pointe. Many dancers, gymnasts and
professionals heartily recommend those made by Capezio. You'll find more
information about it in the <a href="Other&#32;leg&#32;exercises.htm">other
leg exercises</a> page. There has been quite many mails from ballet dancers
recommending prolonged daily wear of ballet boots while not dancing or
exercising in order to train balance, the feet's flexibility and strength and to
be able to stay en pointe for as long as needed. It may be true. See more about that in the </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="balletboots.htm">ballet
boots</a> page. However, if you're to wear this type of apparel on a daily basis
always remember to stretch the feet, to do the point exercises, among those the ballet
positions. This has to be done daily in order to allow the feet to keep their
strength and flexibility. Otherwise prolonged wear (more than 5-6 hours a day) may damage your feet.</font> </P>

  <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> <P><font size="2">Something that also has been
  mentioned in e-mails from Germany, The Netherlands and, to my surprise, Russia
  are the positive effects of combining contortion and rather extreme
  tight-lacing / corsetry. I have received descriptions, pictures and videos
  from professionals using this method, lacing their waist as much as 25 cm
  24-7, except for toilet needs, exercising and performance. The exercises they
  do are the advanced ones from the schedule and according </font> 
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" size="2">
to what I</FONT> can see the contortion training makes it easier for them to
  tight-lace rather extremely as well as the tight-lacing </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" size="2">help</FONT>s</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" size="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2> them to get more limber faster</FONT> 
and most have been able to fold
  their backs a little bit over a year after beginning</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>!
  One </FONT><font size="2" face="Arial">of the reasons can be that the
  corset simulates the effect to the body of a deep backbend or a backfold where the organs
  are very much compressed and displaced
  and the ability to breathe deeply is reduced. The corset wearer's bodies has
  adapted to this due to the constriction and therefore the positions involving
  backbends are much easier to do than normally. As some corsets, so called
  pipe-stems, lengthen the spine, this also makes it easier to bend it in all
  directions. </font><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><font size="2">I haven't seen any
documentation on this before, so I keep this open for discussion.</font></P>

  </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Also the enviroment in the room can be important. 
Never have a cool temperature in the room
(less than 18 °C) while exercising. It's obvious since it's very important to 
keep the well effects of the warmup while exercising. </FONT> Of course it's
easier to breathe and not to need to sweat while doing exercises in a cold room,
but </FONT><font face="Arial" size="2">you risk injuring yourself as the
well-effects of the warm up wear off very quickly. Again I would like to point
out that you always should remember to be warmed up before performing and if
your performance is to last longer periods always be properly clothed.</font> </P>

<P align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><u>ALWAYS DO WARM UP BEFORE YOU START TO DO SOME SERIOUS STRETCHING!</u> </P>
</FONT>
</B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>This is very important, no matter whether you can sit on your
shoulders, do the best oversplits in the world or are a new beginner. A good warm up can be any activity that will make your blood circulate like running around a little bit, maybe in stairs and then first doing the exercises lightly stretching to where you can get without feeling that the muscles get
tense. </FONT>This means no real stretching, but during several repeats you go to the the most flexible position where you feel
comfortable, but not further! <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Many recommend doing the
yoga sun greeting rapidly repeatedly until you are warm. </FONT> The warmups promote circulation, respiration and general loosening of joint
bindings.</P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P ALIGN="CENTER"><u>Without warming up you will most likely get hurt!</u></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> </P>
</FONT><P> Another thing worth to remember is that many things that you do during the day can be done in a flexible
way. Why not bend forward with legs straight when you're going to tie your shoe laces or maybe
chat, read books or watch TV while in a split, oversplit or backbend, backfold when you get
there. You will feel very healthy of this and at the same time you will prevent any loss of flexibility during the
day</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>. This will also make you more ready for the more serious
exercises</FONT></FONT><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">. However don't
forget to stay warmed up. If you're not flexible at all before you begin using
these exercises I would recommend to do some </font><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> easy stretching exercises or easier yoga asanas
</FONT>for a month</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>. Some basic flexibility won't hurt and it will be much easier to do even the easiest
exercise.</P>
</FONT>
<P>If you aren't strong in your back you will also need to to strenghten it, so you can return to an upright position after a backbend. One way is to lie on your back on the top of a gym horse,
couch or bed with someone sitting on your lower legs, with your upper body overhanging the edge and bending back down and then up again. Another way is to lie across two soft chairs supported by your shoulders and hips and flex your back. Both these exercises will need someone to assist you
initially. </P>
<P align="center">
<b>Post warm up</b> </P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>After warming up you're ready to do some serious stretching.
</FONT>The exercises are built up like a very easy looking program where the level increases with the number of the
exercises.</FONT><font face="Arial" size="2"> D<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>o
all exercises till you reach the most advanced exercises you can do for each group of
muscles. </FONT></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">You will feel which exercises that correspond to which muscle group.
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> If you </FONT></font><font face="Arial">want to </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>do all the exercises this will take </FONT>approx 3
hours. </font>As you advance you can skip some of the easier preparing
exercises, but always ask us, or if you have one, your coach. Instead such
exercises can be used as a part of your warm up. If you are a newbie don't do
more advanced exercises than you can handle. Do the exercises you are good at
and those that are difficult, but that you still can manage to some extent. </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">They
are supposed to be a challenge and will help you improve. That's the way you get
results. On the other hand if you go to fast and do exercises that are far too
difficult for you to handle you might end up injuring yourself.&nbsp;</font> </P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>The exercises are set so that the easiest come first and then the level of advancement increases the further you go. Always begin from the first exercise and work towards the more
advanced. </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>When you've succeeded with the exercise you're doing then move along to the next exercise. Continuing like that in time you will be able to do all of them and then it's good to do as many of them as
possible. After each session write down which exercises you've done in a
notebook. This way you'll know what you've done the day before, but you'll also
be able to see how you're advancing.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>
<p>The way to see whether you shouldn't do an exercise is that it's too
difficult to do. <b>Then </b></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <B> don't do it - yet</B></FONT><B><font face="Arial" size="2">,
but do do it when you're ready for it! Yes, I'm repeating myself, but this is
very important and I don't want you to injure yourself!</font><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>The pictures are to show how the exercises are to be
done, but also to show how it will look when maximum flexibility in the exercise is
reached. Don't worry if you can't do them as good as the persons in the
pictures. Instead use the most advanced pictures to set your goal.
You will get there sooner than you think.</FONT></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>Do not jerky actions. Try to stretch out
as much as you can without getting hurt or being uncomfortable. </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2> Don't forget that with the exercises you are to achieve the maximum flexibility by stretching out as much as possible</FONT>
so don't give up! You will get further sooner than you expect. The 1-2-3-4-5 is a progressive stretch a little bit at each
count, then stay there counting 1-2-3-4-5 or if you're comfortable until you
feel the muscle being strained. Then release only a few degrees to a resting
position where it
feels more comfortable or if instructed to an initial position and continue the
stretch from where you were at the count of 5 the last time, but trying to get a
bit further while counting 1-2-3-4-5. </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2> In the last repeat try to stay as long as possible in the position. </FONT> </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>Each
repeat is a count of 1-2-3-4-5.</FONT> </p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">If you are lucky enough to have an
assistant to stretch you </font><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(of course always <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>after warming up</FONT>)<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2> 
</FONT> relax while your
assistant stretches you out until it's not possible to go further<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>.
</FONT>
</FONT><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Do not try to counteract. Unless
otherwise instructed do the assisted stretches the same way as if you were
without an assistant, with the difference that the assistant will hold you
longer in the finishing position at the count of 5. In the beginning when doing
an exercise, assisted or not, or if you have been able to stretch further than
you've been able to do before it can hurt while in the position. </font><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2> This is normal and will only last for around a week</FONT> 
or two</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>.

</FONT>that you can master it perfectly </FONT> <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> and see or feel that you've achieved what is shown on the pictures</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>.
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> Let your own body set the limits and instead of overdoing
<i> do many repeats</i>. Repeats are the key! 10-25 repeats are </FONT></FONT><font face="Arial" size="2">usually
</font><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>the best depending on your age, gender, flexibility etc. The number of repeats in this case is a recommendation. If it should be carried out 20 times and you carry it out 40 times, it doesn't mean that you will get twice the flexibility and if you carry it out 60 times you may find that your muscles are stiffening up again. Try to keep the repeats on a level that feels good.
</FONT>The amount of repeats are only a recommendation. </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>You'll find very quickly which amount of repeats is the best for
you</FONT>, but don't do less than 10 repeats</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> <BR>

<B><font face="Arial" size="2"> The only situation where &quot;overstretching&quot;
is allowed is when doing assisted stretches since you're to be completely relaxed and

everyone. It can take days for some while other need months. </FONT></FONT><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Some
</font><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>quickly gets flexible in their back and at the
same time hits the wall when it comes to the splits. Others manage the splits,
but has difficulties with doing backbends. Don't let that stop you. Do more

<p><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>If you have time feel free to repeat the schedule (I think you will very
soon). That is one of the keys to success. You should notice an increase in your flexibility and
strength towards the end of your exercise period.</FONT></p>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>After doing the stretching exercises it can be good to do the stretches, but only with one repeat, the same way as you did in the warm up. This way you can convince yourself and, most important, your mind what your real flexibility is and this will help you the next time when you stretch out. Those five minutes doing this are as important as the whole exercise. What the brain believes and what's really happening are two different things.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Also it's good to have someone watching you while you exercise, not only to make certain you carry them out correctly, but to ensure your backbends are carried out by the whole spine and not just between two vertebrae. Particular care should be taken in the area of the lower back. Finally when you do backbend exercises
<b> always</b> </FONT></FONT> <font face="Arial" size="2">do frontbend exercises
afterwards</font><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>.</FONT>

</FONT></FONT> <P align="left"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3">Assisted
stretching</font></b> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><P>If you have difficulty getting into the position or to keep the stretch you
<u> always
should</u> have someone to <u><a href="assparex.htm"> assist you</a></u>. It's the
best way to get the best results and most athletes, dancers, gymnasts and other
professionals have their coaches to assist them in their stretching. One of the assistants most important
functions is to keep you in the position, since otherwise you'll most likely go
out of the position or stretch far to early. The assistant should push you firmly
and if you're advanced very firmly into the position and then hold you in it for at least 30 seconds, then release so that there's no stretch for a short time,
again repeating giving it a little bit more stretch than the last time as many times as mentioned in the exercise schedule
or more until the muscles can't be stretched more. For each repeat the time the assistant holds you should increase with
a few seconds seconds. <b>
You must stay completely relaxed at all times.</b> The second most important
function of the assistant is to see that you don't get out of the position. In the beginning t</FONT><font face="Arial"><FONT SIZE=2>his</FONT> </font><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2> method can be quite uncomfortable and even very painful depending on your pain
treshold, but no pain gain. The secret is not to give up and you'll soon find
that you prefer to be assisted than stretching by yourself.&nbsp;Assisted
stretches always give far better results than if you try to do it yourself, but
this is of course your and the coaches prerogative to choose which method to
use. As force is included the trust towards the assistant is of greatest
importance.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2>The pictures above are of a contortion
student being stretched
into a 270 degree oversplit. All repeats were carried out (with a resting around 10 degrees
less from the last repeats) on both legs from sitting in a regular split to the
270 degrees oversplit. As you can see her first attempts weren't comfortable as you can see, but today she can sit
comfortably in a oversplit for longer periods having the rear leg horizontally on the
floor and the front leg vertically on the wall and then change doing the same
with the other legs <b>without standing up!</b>&nbsp; It took her two months
doing this daily to achieve this position and six
more to be able to sit in the position for as much as one hour comfortably.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
<P align="center"><img border="0" src="kwiciuosp01.jpg" width="245" height="196"> </P>
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">An other example is this rhythmic gymnast. Her
oversplits are amazing, up to 300 degrees, and she can apparently, according to
her coach, stay in them without any
time limits at all. The secret is that she has been assisted in her stretches on a daily basis
from the very first beginning, when she started doing gymnastics.</font> </P>
<P align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><img border="0" src="bb-077.jpg" width="255" height="201"></font><img border="0" src="bb104.JPG" width="178" height="201"> </P>
<P><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">An other example is Helena. She only uses assisted stretches and you can judge from the result
yourself. The picture to the right is her backbend which she reached after over
one year. Normally it
takes at least the double amount of time to accomplish a backfold like this no matter
what age you are and then you normally won't get that good without being
assisted.&nbsp;</font> </P>
<P><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">As I mentioned before assisted stretches are very uncomfortable in the beginning, but your pain treshold and
especially your endurance will improve much faster than you think and this makes
it much easier than you think from seeing the picture above. The assistant is
helping you with what you normally wouldn't stand - holding you in a position
you wouldn't stand, because of lack of endurance or of too much initial pain or
discomfort. This,
however, changes very rapidly to helping you reaching a certain position that
you wouldn't be able to reach without any help even if you're comfortable doing
it. The explanation is simple. For
most the initial reaching of a certain level of flexibility assisted is most
uncomfortable or even unbearable the first two weeks to the first two months
depending on how far you go and depending on how flexible you are in the
beginning, but it gets less and less uncomfortable the longer time you practice
and after that amount of time you should feel comfortable in the position and
instead work on staying as longer and longer in the position and getting deeper
and deeper into it and still feeling comfortable. That's also the reason why most professionals like
acrobats, dancers, contortionists and gymnasts prefer assisted stretches. You
always should have a 20% flexibility reserve when you're to perform in order to
always being comfortable while working. Every professional knows this. Also
assisted stretching is the most efficient way to extreme flexibility and it goes much
faster than any other mean of stretching (professionals know that too) and most important - you can stay
relaxed during all of the stretch and then it also gets comfortable! Also your pain treshold will change the more you do assisted
stretches making it possible for you to advance much more and faster than in the beginning.

<P>Persons with hypermobility, hence with natural flexibility, should do assisted stretches as much as possible. This decreases the symptoms of hypermobility. If assisted stretches are done as described they are a very good and effective alternative for achieving supplenes much faster.
Every exercise can be done assisted and in most you'll find notes suggesting how
this can be done, but don't be afraid to experiment. It's not dangerous if you
and your assistant know your limits and you trust eachother.&nbsp;Also feel free

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><P>Important notice 1!</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2> Always do a frontbend after doing a backbend, even if only once. The more advanced backbend is the more advanced frontbend should be.
They should correspond to eachother. This is for balance in the back, but also strenghtens and
lengthens the spine and the muscles around it.
It's also important to do all the other types of exercises. They all correspond
to eachother and will help you to get better allover.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><P>&nbsp; </P>
<P>Important notice 2!</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2> If you have suffered from one or many dislocations in either hips or shoulders you should learn to do controlled
dislocations as well as use assisted stretching as you mainly used method when
doing the exercises here. This often is a symptom of hypermobility and you will sooner or later dislocate again.
This is often missed by MD's unless this is mentioned. One reason could be that
around 40% of the population are hypermobile and often without
knowing it. The symptoms can often be&nbsp; pain in joints, hypermobility and dislocations of the
joints (for example if you can learn how to do a split in a short time,
partially dislocate your shoulders - that often means that you will hear a
popping or cracking sound - or if you have overbent elbows you most likely are
hypermobile). Very often the symptoms show gradually, often with pain or dislocations, and
sometimes increase with
time to states that aren't controllable. It's not a question if it happens, but when. To prevent this it's important to learn to do controlled dislocations, build up strenght and flexibility around all joints and practicing
contortion does all this. The reason is simple. If a symptom like a dislocation occurs and it isn't controlled your muscles will go into spasm. Being able to do a controlled dislocation prevents
this and it should be done many times on a daily basis. A controlled dislocation
is a dislocation where you are able to dislocate the joint, move the limb <u>with
the help of another limb or with help from someone that assists you</u> and then
putting it back to it's normal state. All joints that can be dislocated should be
trained in this order of fashion and the controlled dislocation must become a
part of your normal range of movement! It's important to train all joints that dislocate, because that you once had an uncontrolled dislocation in i.e. the hips doesn't mean that the next won't be in the shoulders
etc and the dislocations gradually worsens for each time making it impossible to
control them in the end.
You should work the same way with backbends and later&nbsp; backfolds since the dislocations
can spread to other areas than the joints around the limbs. When working on backbends and especially backfolds put a stick, a finger or
something appropriate to increase the fold and partially dislocate the vertebrae.
The last part is <u>very</u> important! Using <a href="contortion_barre.htm">the
contortion barre</a> is recommended. Persons that have experienced or experiences symptoms like dislocating, pain in joint and hypermobility should work towards being able to do
all of the program to perfection, as a prevention, to be able to get the joints and the muscles around the joints supple to the outer limit and learn to control them in situations like
this by doing controlled dislocations as much as possible.
Also all exercises, if possible, should be done assisted with firm stretches
until the maximum suppleness is reached at least once each day, preferrably more! This might be
difficult, uncomforable and even painful, but <i> only</i> in the beginning. It's not as difficult as it sounds and that is something you've probably found out by now or
will.</FONT> <font face="Arial" size="2">D</font><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>o this with an open mind and enjoy
