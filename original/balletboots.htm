<p align="center"><img border="0" src="balletani.gif" width="48" height="80"></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;...ballet boots</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As you know by now achieving the pointe can help
you in order to do more of the exercises better. However it's not always possible to have
footbenders made nor to have someone to assist you in stretching your feet into
the utmost pointe position. Normally this isn't a problem, but the situation can
occur especially if you live in a place where no-one can assist you. This is
a problem that often has been addressed by internet users of this exercise
schedule. At the same time many ballet dancers has mentioned their everyday use
of ballet boots as a quite simple solution to this problem. Also one of the
co-authors of this handbook, Lotta, wears ballet boots only and on a daily
basis. Much of the information therefore comes from there as well as from the
users that has mentioned this.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="http://wandererstraining.com/tchb/ballet%20ancle%20boot.jpg" width="285" height="192"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ballet ancle boots.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="http://wandererstraining.com/tchb/ballet%20knee%20lenght%20boot.jpg" width="148" height="193"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ballet knee length boots&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">First of all if you're to wear ballet boots on a
daily basis you should wear ballet ancle boots and shorter. They won't restrict
your feet as much as ballet knee length boots and are more comfortable for
everyday wear once you get used to them. However as every ballet boot they WILL
force you to stand en pointé and that is also the point in wearing them. The
reason dancers wear ballet boots is to harden the feet, increase the flexibility
and strength (which however won't happen if you wear ballet knee length boots
for extended periods). Ballet boots can easily be found in numerous shoe stores
or Ebay on the internet.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="ballet-heels1.jpg" width="183" height="315"><img border="0" src="ballet-heels2.jpg" width="229" height="315"><img border="0" src="ballet-heels3.jpg" width="235" height="315"></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">When you order a ballet boot it's
important that you see to that it is of especially
rigid making it impossible to move the foot out from the pointe. This will make them
perfect for their purpose.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ballet boots help both in
training the pointe as for holding the feet when getting into and holding
different positions. It's uncomfortable, a bit painful and difficult to some
extent in the beginning. Telling otherwise would be lying, but it gives much quicker results than using a
footbender and the effects are better in the longer run. If you choose this
method it can also
require quite much from you since you will have to wear the ballet boots while
you practice and as much as possible on a regular basis. Usually it's said that that
three hours en pointe when using the ballet boots daily is a minimum and from </font><font size="2" face="Arial">there
the time should be increased by one-two hourse each week to month until you can
wear them as much as you wish. However if you're to wear ballet boots for longer
than six hours on a daily basis you must stretch the feet to overpointe and also
do the ballet positions daily for extra strengthening. Otherwise you risk
damaging your feet and can end up being stuck in ballet boots!!!</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" dynsrc="learn2walk.asf" start="fileopen" loop="infinite" width="320" height="261"></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you wonder how it will be in the beginning the
video clip shows a perfect example. This is Lotta shot after one week of
walking in ballet boots. As you can see it wen't quite well even if it was a bit
unsteady, but again that was only after a week. It's a bit of learning to walk
all over again and today she walks in the ballet boots like if they were any
high heel shoes. However you should, as a new-beginner, avoid walking in stairs
in the beginning as this is far from easy.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="ballet-me1.jpg" width="203" height="295"><img border="0" src="ballet-me2.jpg" width="224" height="295"><img border="0" src="ballet-me3.jpg" width="225" height="295"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"> Above you can
see what it looks like when ballet boots are worn. As you can see they can be
used both as inner and outer wear as for clubbing.. and for exercising..&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> The ballet boots are
constructed in a way that they force you to have your feet in a fixed pointe or
beyond pointe position.
This is accomplished by bonings and a strong lacing. After you've laced them in
you won't be able to move the foot into anything less than a pointe position
except for beyond a pointe position. Also, wearing the ballet boots will reduce the shoe size by increasing the arch of the foot thus decreasing the length of the foot from
heel to toe. There are some tips for you if you're to wear ballet boots on a
regular basis.&nbsp;</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Stretch the feet everyday after wearing the
    ballet boots!&nbsp;This way you'll avoid any ill effects of wearing high
    heels.</font></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Do the ballet positions everyday for as long
    as necessary to strengthen your feet.&nbsp;This way you'll avoid any ill
    effects of wearing high heels.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Try to use 1 or a half size larger than your
    normal shoe size. The trying on for the first time can be very uncomfortable
    since you won't be used to have the foot in the pointe and especially when
    standing. While trying on the
    boots the laces of the boot should be completely closed and if you can't
    move the foot out of the pointe position the boot &quot;fits like a glove&quot;.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Always lace the boots until the laces meet and
    you feel that you can't move your feet to less than the pointe
    position!&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Gradually build up your endurance until you can wear them with no problems for many hours a
    day.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2"> Pad the toes. You're putting a lot of pressure on the tips of your
    toes, padding helps a lot. Lamb's wool seems to be effective, the stuffing from pillows
    helps, but you have to keep replacing it. Check with a local ballet store to see what they
    use, or check online.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Keep your toenails short. It hurts to have your toenails pushed back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Stay close to something like a wall in the
    beginning, or stable chair when you stand. You may need to hold something for
    balance, falling on the floor is a bit ungraceful. :)&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">When starting out, walk with someone holding your hand. It might feel
    childish, but if you suddenly lose your balance it's better than
    falling and as they say you have to learn to walk before you can run.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Always put the heel down first, then the toes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Take it easy. Don't start out wearing them for hours at a time, a
    half hour of standing and walking is just fine in the beginning, but never
    less than that.</font></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Practice the pointe either bare feet or using
    pointe ballet shoes daily if you wear ballet boots to build up strenght.
    Remember that the ballet boots only are an aid even if they are comfortable
    to wear.</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="balletani.gif" width="48" height="80"></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Here are some pictures of dancers and
contortionists using ballet boots in their exercising. As you can see the feet always are in the pointe position thanks to the ballet boots and in
the first picture the foot is stretched beyond the pointe position. Also notice
that the ballet boots can be a good help in order to make ease the exercises. </font></p>
